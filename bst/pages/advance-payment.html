					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

									<h2> <a id="what-is-advance-payment">What is Advance Payment?</a> </h2>
									<p>Beginning, 11/4/2012, on eligible CDMA monthly plans, when you add money to your account and the new account balance is&nbsp;greater than or equal&nbsp;to the amount of your next total monthly payment, we will automatically deduct that amount from your account and apply it towards your next monthly payment. This way you won’t have to worry about paying at the end of your month and ensures your account balance goes towards your monthly service charges and not to unexpected 3rd party/Value Added services (e.g., ringtones, International calls, etc.). If you want to purchase additional services, just add more money to your account.
										<br>
										<br> NOTE:&nbsp;No partial cash&nbsp;<em>payments</em>&nbsp;can be applied towards the next monthly payment. If your account balance is LESS than the amount of the next monthly payment, you can add additional funds to your account by adding cash, a Re-Boost PIN, credit/debit card until the account balance is enough to cover the next total monthly payment.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a>
									<h2> <a id="how-do-i-know-if-my-plan-is-eligible-for-advance-payment">How do I know if my plan is eligible for Advance Payment?</a> </h2>
									<p>Only monthly plans are eligible for Advance Payment.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a>
									<h2> <a id="can-i-cancel-an-advance-payment-on-my-account">Can I cancel an Advance Payment on my account?</a> </h2>
									<p>Yes, you can cancel an Advance Payment on your account up to one hour before your monthly payment due date (11:00pm in your time zone).</p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a>
									<h2> <a id="what-happens-if-i-have-an-advance-payment-on-my-account-and-i-want-to-change-my-plan-or-change-my-device">What happens if I have an Advance Payment on my account and I want to change my plan or change my device?</a> </h2>
									<p>If you have an Advance Payment on your account and attempt to switch your plan, the Advance Payment will need to be canceled. You will be presented with a warning message before this happens and have the opportunity to agree or cancel. If you are just changing your handset but remaining on the same plan, your Advance Payment will remain unchanged. However, if you are changing your handset and the new handset requires you to also change your plan, again, you will be advised that the Advance Payment must be canceled to continue.</p>

									<h2> <a id="what-if-my-advance-payment-was-canceled-and-i-want-to-pay-for-my-next-month-in-advance">What if my Advance Payment was canceled and I want to pay for my next month in advance?</a> </h2>
									<p>As long as your account balance is equal to or greater than your next total monthly payment and there isn't already an Advance Payment in place, you will be able to set up an Advance Payment. If you don't have enough money in your account to pay for your next month of service, you can add additional funds to your account by adding cash, a Re-Boost PIN, credit/debit card until the account balance is enough to cover the next total monthly payment and then we will automatically deduct that amount from your balance and make your next total monthly payment. Keep in mind that your <u>total</u>&nbsp;monthly payment is your monthly recurring charge PLUS the amount of any ADD-ONs you purchased.</p>

								<div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a>
									<h2> <a id="can-i-pay-in-advance-for-more-than-one-month-at-a-time">Can I pay in Advance for more than one month at a time?</a> </h2>
									<p>No, you can only pay for one month of service in Advance. If you add enough money for more than one month of service, we will only pay for one month of service in advance. After that next monthly payment is taken, you can set up an Advance Payment for the following month.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a>
									<h2> <a id="can-advance-payment-be-disabled-or-cancelled-permanently">Can Advance Payment be disabled or cancelled permanently?</a> </h2>
									<p>No, anytime you add money to your account and your balance becomes equal to or greater than your next total monthly payment, an automatic Advance Payment will be made on your account. These changes to how your funds are handled are now a part of our terms and conditions of service. However, keep in mind that you can always cancel the Advance Payment up to one hour before midnight of your payment due date.</p>
