					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

									<em>Effective</em> March 8, 2011<br> 
									
									<br> The following terms apply to your (which includes anyone who uses our Services) 
									use of and access to any Boost Mobile LLC, together with its subsidiaries, affiliates, 
									agents, and licensors (collectively "Boost"), owned or operated website ("Website")

								<p class="align_content">
									In addition to other agreements between you and Boost, these terms explain 
									the policies that govern your access to and use of our Website and Network.&nbsp; 
									By accessing or using our Website or Network, you agree to these terms

										Excessive use is determined by resource consumption relative to that 
										of a typical individual user of the Network and not by the use of any 
										particular application.

									(1) participate in spidering, harvesting, or any other unauthorized collection of 
									e-mail addresses, screen names, or other identifiers of others or participate in 
									using software (including "spyware") designed to facilitate such activity; 
									(2) collect responses from unsolicited messages; or 
									(3) use any of our mail servers or another site's mail server to relay mail 
									without the express permission of the account holder or the site.
								</p> 
								
								<h3 class="color_orange">NETWORK SECURITY AND INTEGRITY</h3> 
								<p class="align_content">
									You may not violate the security of our Network in any way. 
									Such violations may result in criminal or civil liability. 
									Boost may, but is not obligated to, investigate any violation of our Network. 
									Boost may cooperate with law enforcement where criminal or unauthorized activity is suspected.

										denial-of-service attacks, mail bombing, news bombing, other flooding techniques, 
										deliberate attempts to overload a system, and broadcast attacks. 
									</li> 
									<br> 
									<li class="bullets">
										<strong><u>Falsification of Origin or Routing Information</u></strong>
										<strong>:</strong> 
										Using, selling, or distributing in conjunction with the Network, any computer 
										program designed to conceal the source or routing information of electronic 
										mail messages in a manner that falsifies an Internet domain, header information, 
										date or time stamp, originating e-mail address, or other identifier. 
									</li> 
									<br> 
									<li class="bullets"> 
										<strong><u>Avoiding System Restrictions</u>:</strong> 
										Using manual or electronic means to avoid any limitations established by Boost 
										or attempting to gain unauthorized access to, alter, or destroy any information
										that relates to any Boost customer or other end-user. Boost may, but is not 
										obligated to, take any action it deems necessary to 
										(1) protect its Network, its rights, or the rights of its customers or third parties, or 
										(2) optimize or improve its Network, services, systems, and equipment. You acknowledge 
										that such action may include, without limitation, employing methods, technologies, 
										or procedures to filter or block messages sent through the Network. Boost may, in its 
										sole discretion and at any time, filter "spam" or prevent "hacking," "viruses," or 
										other potential harms without regard to any preference you may have communicated to us.
									</li> 
								</ul> 
								
								<h3 class="color_orange">INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS POLICY</h3> 
								<p class="align_content">
									We have the right, but are not obligated, to strictly enforce 
									this Policy through self-help, active investigation, litigation, 
									and prosecution.
								</p> 
								
								<p class="align_content">
									Boost reserves the right to act immediately and without notice to restrict, 
									suspend, or terminate your use of the Network if it reasonably determines 
									that your conduct may: 
									(1) expose Boost to sanctions, prosecution, civil action,or other liability; 
									(2) cause harm to or interfere with the integrity or normal operations of 
									Boost's Network or networks with which Boost is interconnected; 
									(3) interfere with another Boost customer's use of the Network; 
									(4) violate any applicable law, rule, or regulation; or 
									(5) otherwise present an imminent risk of harm to Boost or its customers. 
								</p> 
								
								<p class="align_content">
									Boost has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor or restrict any 
									uses of the Network that Boost reasonably believes in its sole discretion 
									violate this AUP. You are solely responsible for all content that you transmit 
									or receive utilizing the Network, and you are responsible for abuse of your account by others.
								</p> 
								<p class="align_content">
									We may also access and disclose any information (including transactional information) 
									related to your access and use of our Network for any lawful reason, including but not limited to: 
									(1) responding to emergencies; 
									(2) complying with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena); 
									(3) protecting our rights or property and those of our customers; or 
									(4) protecting users of those services and other carriers from fraudulent, 
									abusive, or unlawful use of or subscription to such services. 
									INDIRECT OR ATTEMPTED BREACHES OF THIS POLICY AND ACTUAL OR ATTEMPTED BREACHES BY A 
									THIRD PARTY ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR USER MAY BE CONSIDERED BREACHES OF 
									THIS POLICYBY SUCH COMPANY, CUSTOMER, OR USER.
								</p> 
								
								<h3 class="color_orange">MISCELLANEOUS</h3> 
								<p class="align_content">
									Any failure to insist upon or enforce performance of any provision in 
									this Policy will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. 
									Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will 
									act to modify any provision in this Policy. Boost may assign its rights 
									and duties under these terms to any party at any time without notice to you. 
									If any provision of this Policy is deemed unlawful, void, or for any reason 
									unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these terms 
									and conditions so that it does not affect the validity and enforceability of 
									any remaining provisions.
								</p> 
								
								<h3 class="color_orange">QUESTIONS, COMMENTS &amp; ABUSE</h3> 
								<p class="align_content">
									If you want to report any violations of this Policy, other than those concerning
