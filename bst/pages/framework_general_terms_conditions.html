					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

								<strong>General Terms and Conditions of Service – Effective 07/01/13</strong>
								<br>
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">General Terms and Conditions of Service</h2> 
							<p>
								Para solicitar esta literatura en español, por favor visitar boostmobile.com/espanol.
							</p> 
							<p>
								Please note that these terms may not be the most current version. A current version 
								of the terms is available at boostmobile.com or upon request. For further information 
								on Boost Mobile plans, products, and services go to boostmobile.com or email 
								<a href="mailto:Boostmobilecustomerassistance@boostmobile.com">Boostmobilecustomerassistance@boostmobile.com</a>. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Basic Definitions</h2> 
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								In this document: (1) "we," "us," "our," and "Boost" mean Sprint Solutions, Inc., 
								as contracting agent on behalf of the applicable Sprint affiliated entities providing 
								the Products and Services; (2) "you," "your," "customer," and "user" mean an account 
								holder or user with us; (3) "Device" means any phone, aircard, mobile broadband device,
								any other device, accessory, or other product that we provide you, we sell to you, or 
								is active on your account with us; and (4) "Service" means our offers, rate or service
								plans, options, wireless services, billing services, applications, programs, products, 
								software, or Devices on your account with us. "Service(s)" also includes any other product 
								or service that we offer or provide to you that references these General Terms and Conditions of Service ("Ts&amp;Cs").
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">The Service Agreement</h2> 
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								These Ts&amp;Cs are part of your service agreement with us (the "Agreement") 
								and constitute a contract under which we provide you Services under terms and 
								conditions that you accept. 
								<strong>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WITH A CLASS WAIVER, 
								A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER, AND A JURY WAIVER PROVISION. 
								</strong>In addition to these Ts&amp;Cs, there are several parts of the Agreement, 
								which includes but is not limited to the following: (i) the subscriber agreement 
								and transaction materials that you receive and accept; (ii) the plan(s) that you 
								chose as set forth in our written services and transaction materials that we provide 
								or refer you to during the sales transaction, including on-line and telephone 
								transactions (if your service plan is not specifically set forth in any in-store 
								brochure or printed materials, the requirements and terms set forth in the current 
								written Agreement and transaction materials apply); (iii) any confirmation materials 
								that we may provide to you; and (iv) the terms set forth in the coverage map brochures. 
								<strong>It is important that you carefully read all of the terms of the Agreement.&nbsp; </strong>
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Additional Terms </h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								Additional terms will apply when you use certain applications, programs, Devices, 
								and services, and these terms will be provided to you prior to your use of the items. 
								Depending on who provides the items, the terms may come from Boost or a third party. 
								You are subject to any terms provided by the third party, and the terms are directly 
								between you and that third party. Boost is not responsible for these third-party items
								and associated terms. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Our Policies</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								Services are subject to our business policies, practices, and procedures ("Policies"). 
								You agree to adhere to all of our Policies when you use our Services. Our Policies are 
								subject to change at any time with or without notice.<strong></strong>
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">When You Accept The Agreement</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								You must have the legal capacity to accept the Agreement. You accept the Agreement when 
								you do any of the following: (a) accept the Agreement through any printed, oral, or electronic 
								statement, for example, on the Web by electronically marking that you have reviewed and accepted; 
								(b) attempt to or in any way use the Services; (c) pay for the Services; or (d) open any package 
								or start any program that says you are accepting the Agreement when doing so. <strong>If you don't 
								want to accept the Agreement, don't do any of these things.</strong>
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Service Activation</h2> 
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								To activate the Service, you must both activate your account and establish an appropriate 
								account balance to pay for pay-per-use charges and applicable subscription charges 
								(defined in the "Types of Charges" section) based on the service plan you select. 
								To establish an account balance, pay a subscription charge, or make any other appropriate 
								payments, follow the instructions provided with the equipment; at boostmobile.com; or through 
								Boost Customer Care.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Our Right To Change The Agreement &amp; Your Related Rights</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								<strong>We may</strong> 
								<strong>change any part of the Agreement at any time, including, but not limited to, rates, 
								charges, how we calculate charges, discounts, coverage, technologies used to provide services, 
								or your terms of Service. If you lose your eligibility for a particular rate plan or if a 
								particular rate plan is no longer supported or available, we may change your rate plan to 
								one for which you qualify.</strong> <strong>We will provide you notice of material changes—and 
								we may provide you notice of non-material changes—in a manner consistent with this Agreement 
								(see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section).</strong> If you continue 
								to access or use our Services or increase your account balance on or after the effective date 
								of a change, you accept the change. Do not access or use our Services after the effective date 
								of a change if you decide to reject the change and terminate Service. You will not be entitled 
								to any credit for the unused portion of your account balance if you decide to terminate Service 
								in response to a change to the Agreement.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Our Right To Suspend Or Terminate Services</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								<strong>We can, without notice, suspend or terminate any Service at any time for any 
								reason. &nbsp;</strong>For example, we can suspend or terminate any Service for the following: 
								(a) failure to have or maintain an appropriate account balance for applicable charges; (b) 
								harassing/threatening/abusing/offending our employees or agents; (c) providing false or 
								inaccurate information; (d) interfering with our operations; (e) using/suspicion of using 
								Services in any manner restricted by or inconsistent with the Agreement and Policies; (f) 
								breaching, failing to follow, or abusing the Agreement or Policies; (g) modifying a Device 
								from its manufacturer specifications (for example, rooting the device); or (h) if we believe 
								the action protects our interests, any customer's interests, or our networks. <strong></strong>
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Your Right To Change Services &amp; When Changes Are Effective</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								The account holder can typically change Services upon request. In some instances, 
								changes may be conditioned on payment of certain charges. The effective date of any 
								changes will depend on our Policies, the old Services, and the requested Services. 
								We will not credit or refund any subscription or other charges as a result of a change 
								in Services. We may, but are not obligated to, provide you the opportunity to authorize 
								someone else to make changes to your Services. You are responsible for any changes to 
								your Services made by a person you authorize, and those changes will be treated as 
								modifications to this Agreement.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Restrictions On Using Services </h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								You can't use our Services: (a) in a way that could cause damage or adversely affect 
								any of our other customers or our reputation, networks, property, or Services; or (b) 
								in any way prohibited by the terms of our Services, the Agreement, or our Policies. 
								You cannot in any manner resell the Services to another party. For additional restrictions 
								on the use of our Services, see our Acceptable Use Policy and Visitors Agreement, 
								which are available on our website, and the detailed plan or other information on 
								Services that we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Your Device, Number, &amp; Email Address</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								We don't manufacture any Device that we might sell to you or that is associated 
								with our Services, and we aren't responsible for any defects, acts, or omissions 
								of the manufacturer. <strong>The only warranties on your Device are the limited 
								warranties given to you by the manufacturer directly or that we pass through. 
								Device performance may vary based on device specifications (for example, a device's software, memory, and storage),
								and device performance may impact access to all of our Services. </strong>This Device
								is sold exclusively for use with our Service and in other coverage areas that we may
								make available to you. As programmed, it will not accept wireless service from another 
								carrier. Except for any legal right you may have to port/transfer your phone number to
								another carrier, you have no—and cannot gain any (for example, through publication, use, etc.)—proprietary, 
								ownership, or other rights to any phone number, identification number, email address, or other 
								identifier that we assign to you, your Device, or your account. We'll notify you if we decide 
								to change or reassign them. 
							</p> 
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Porting/Transferring Phone Numbers</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								We don't guarantee that number transfers to or from us will be successful. 
								If you authorize another carrier to transfer a number away from us, then that 
								is considered a request by you to us to terminate all of the Services associated 
								with that number. <br> <br> 
							</p>
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Coverage; Where Your Device Will Work; Service Speeds</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								Our coverage maps are available at our authorized retail locations or boostmobile.com.
								The specific network coverage you get will depend on the radio transmissions your Device 
								can pick up and Services you've chosen. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of
								our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't 
								available everywhere. Coverage and Service speeds are not guaranteed. Coverage is subject to 
								change without notice. Service speeds may depend on the Service purchased. Actual speeds will 
								vary. Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength, and Service speed is not an exact science.
								There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that—along with other factors 
								both within and beyond our control (for example, network problems, network or Internet congestion, 
								software, signal strength, your Device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, 
								server speeds of the websites you access, actions of third parties, etc.) —may result in dropped 
								and blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service. Services
								that rely on location information, such as E911 and GPS navigation, depend on your Device's ability 
								to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. While your Device 
								is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your Device in any manner until the software 
								update is complete.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Roaming</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that we may make 
								available to you based on our agreements with other carriers. These agreements may change from
								time to time, and roaming coverage is subject to change without notice. Your ability to receive 
								roaming coverage depends on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and the availability
								of roaming coverage. We make no guarantee that roaming coverage will be available. Roaming coverage
								may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas. Your Device will generally indicate 
								when you're roaming. Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of minutes
								used while roaming may apply. Certain Services may not be available or work the same when roaming 
								(for example, data Services, voicemail, call waiting, etc.). &nbsp;For information on whether roaming
								applies, see your service plan details.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">About Data Services &amp; Content</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								Our data Services and your Device may allow you to access the Internet, text, pictures, 
								video, games, graphics, music, email, applications, sound, and other materials ("Data Content")
								or send Data Content elsewhere. Some Data Content is available from us or our vendors, while 
								other Data Content can be accessed from others (for example, third party websites, games, 
								ringers, applications, etc.). We make absolutely no guarantees about the Data Content that
								you access on your Device. <strong>Data Content may be: (1) unsuitable for children/minors;
								(2) unreliable or inaccurate; or (3) offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You're solely 
								responsible for evaluating the Data Content accessed by you or anyone through your Services.
								We strongly recommend that you monitor data usage by children/minors</strong>. Data Content 
								from third parties may also harm your Device or its software. We are not responsible for any
								Data Content. We are not responsible for any damage caused by any Data Content that you access
								through your Services, that you load on your Device, or that you request that our representatives
								access or load on your Device. To protect our networks and Services or for other reasons, 
								we may place restrictions on accessing certain Data Content (such as certain websites, 
								applications, etc.); impose separate charges; limit throughput or the amount of data that you 
								can transfer; or otherwise limit or terminate Services. If we provide you storage for Data Content 
								that you have purchased, then we may delete the Data Content without notice or place restrictions/limits 
								on the use of storage areas. Data Content stored on a Device, transmitted over our networks, or stored by
								Boost may be deleted, modified, or damaged. You may not be able to make or receive voice calls while using
								data Services. Data Content provided by our vendors or third parties is subject to cancellation or
								termination at any time without notice to you, and you may not receive a refund for any unused
								portion of the Data Content.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Specific Terms &amp; Restrictions On Using Data Services</h2> 
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								In addition to the rules for using all of our other Services, unless we identify the Service 
								or Device that you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, 
								wireless routers, Data Link, etc.), you can't use our data Services: (1) with server devices
								or host computer applications, or other systems that drive continuous, heavy traffic or data
								sessions; (2) as a substitute or backup for private lines or frame relay connections; or (3)
								for any other unintended use as we determine in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to
								limit, suspend, or constrain any heavy, continuous data usage that adversely impacts our 
								networks' performance or hinders access to our networks. If your Services include Web or 
								data access, you also can't use your Device as a modem for computers or other equipment, 
								unless we identify the Service or Device you have selected as specifically intended for
								that purpose (for example, with "phone as modem" plans, mobile broadband card plans,
								wireless router plans, etc.).
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Software License </h2> 
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								If Boost provides you software as part of the Service and there are not software license 
								terms provided with the software (by Boost or by a third party), then Boost grants you a limited, 
								revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the software to access the Services 
								for your own individual use. You will not sell, resell, transfer, copy, translate, publish, 
								create derivative works of, make any commercial use of, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, 
								or disassemble the software. Boost may revoke this license at any time.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Fees, Activation &amp; Miscellaneous Charges</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								Based on our Policies, we may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, 
								or other fees to establish, change, or maintain Services. Certain transactions may 
								also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, 
								handset upgrades, etc.). You will be provided notice of these types of fees before we 
								complete the requested transaction. 
							</p> 
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Usage Charges</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								The types of charges that you incur will vary depending on the Service used and your 
								service plan. <strong>You are responsible for the Services on your account and associated 
								charges, including charges made by a person you permit to have direct or indirect access 
								to your device even if you did not authorize its use.</strong> Charges may include, but 
								are not limited to, prepayment for service charges; charges for additional services; and
								taxes, surcharges, and fees associated with your Services. For the actual usage charges 
								applicable to your Service, see the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer
								you to during the sales transaction or on our website. Depending on your Services, charges
								for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call 
								forwarding, data calls, texts, and Web access. If you (the account holder) allow end 
								users to access or use your Device, you authorize end users to access, download, and 
								use Services. You will generally be charged for use of Services before or at the time
								of use in accordance with your service plan. In certain instances, we may charge at 
								some point after you use the Service. Rates that vary based on the time of access will
								be determined based on the location of the network equipment providing service and not 
								the location of your Device or your Device's area code (if applicable). Charges are generally 
								deducted from your account balance (for example, pay-per-use charges, subscription charges, etc.), 
								though in some instances you may be able to pay for certain Services through a credit card, debit
								card, or other payment method. If you have incurred charges or fees that were not charged prior 
								to your account balance reaching a zero balance, we may deduct these outstanding, unpaid charges
								and fees from any subsequent amounts you add to your account balance. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Types of Charges</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								We typically assess the following types of charges: (1) "pay-per-use charges," which are 
								charges assessed each time a Service is used; (2) "subscription charges," which are charges 
								that allow you access to a Service or provide you a certain amount of use of a Service for a 
								defined period of time. Subscription charges for Services end at 11:59 p.m., in the time zone 
								in which your phone number is based, on the last day of your subscription period. Also, depending
								on your Service, certain types of subscription charges may be assessed automatically upon activation
								and automatically assessed for subsequent subscription periods; and (3) "download charges," which are
								charges assessed when you download or access content, which we collect on behalf of ourselves or
								third-party content providers. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">How We Calculate Your Charges </h2>
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								<strong>Regular Voice Calls:</strong> We round up partial minutes of use to the
								next full minute. Time starts when you press "Talk" or your Device connects to 
								the network and stops when you press "End" or the network connection otherwise 
								breaks. You're charged for all calls that connect, even to answering machines, 
								voicemail, or voice transcription services. You won't be charged for unanswered calls 
								or if you get a busy signal. For incoming calls answered, you're charged from the time
								shortly before the Device starts ringing until you press "End" or the network connection 
								otherwise breaks. You're charged for the entire call based on the rate that applies to the
								time period in which the call starts. However, the types of charges actually deducted from
								your account balance will vary depending on your Service. Call time data displayed on your
								Device may be inaccurate and may not be relied upon for determining charges to your account. 
								Call time for a single call may be limited. If the call exceeds the limit, then it may be 
								automatically terminated. <strong>Data Usage:</strong> Depending on your Service, you may 
								be charged for data usage. Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, data usage is measured 
								in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes—not in minutes/time. 1024 bytes equals 1 kilobyte
								("KB"), 1024 KB equals 1 megabyte, and 1024 megabytes equals 1 gigabyte. Bytes are rounded up
								to KB, so you will be charged at least 1 KB for each data usage session ("data session"). 
								Rounding occurs at the end of each data session and sometimes during a data session.
								Depending on your data Services, usage may be charged against an allowance or on a 
								fixed price per KB, and you may be subject to limitations on the amount of data usage.
								If you are charged on a fixed price per KB, any fractional cents will be rounded up to
								the next cent. You are charged for all data directed to your Device's Internet address,
								including data sessions you did not initiate and for incomplete transfers. As long as
								your Device is connected to our data networks, you may incur data charges. Examples of
								data for which you will be charged includes the size of a requested file or Data Content 
								(game, ringer, etc.); Web page graphics (logos, pictures, banners, advertisement, etc.); 
								additional data used in accessing, transporting, and routing the file on our network; data 
								from partial or interrupted downloads; re-sent data; and data associated with unsuccessful 
								attempts to reach websites or use applications. These data charges are in addition to any 
								charges for the Data Content itself (game, ringer, etc.). Data used and charged to you will 
								vary widely, even between identical actions or data sessions. Estimates of data usage—for example,
								the size of downloadable files—are not reliable predictors of actual usage. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Taxes &amp; Government Fees</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								You agree to pay all federal, state, and local taxes, fees, and other assessments that 
								we're required by law to collect and remit to the government on the Services that we 
								provide to you. These charges may change from time to time without advance notice.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Surcharges</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								You agree to pay all Boost surcharges ("Surcharges"), which may include, but are not limited 
								to: Federal Universal Service; Regulatory and Administrative charges; gross receipts 
								charges, and other charges. <strong>Surcharges are <em>not</em> taxes, and we are not 
								required by law to assess them. They are part of our rates we choose, at our discretion,
								to collect from you to recover certain costs, and are kept by us. The number and type
								of Surcharges will be provided and may vary depending upon the location of the transaction
								or the primary account address of the payment method or Device and can change over time. 
								We determine the amount for these charges, and these amounts are subject to change as are
								the components used to calculate these amounts. </strong>We will provide you notice of any 
								changes to Surcharges in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To 
								Each Other Under The Agreement" section). However, because some Surcharges are based on
								amounts set by the government or based on government formulas, it will not always be 
								possible to provide advance notice of new Surcharges or changes in the amount of existing
								Surcharges. Information on Surcharges is provided during the sales transaction and is 
								available on our website.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Disputing Charges </h2>
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								Any dispute to a charge that we assess you must be made in writing within 60 
								days of the date we deduct the charge from your account balance. You accept 
								all charges not properly disputed within the above time period. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">About Account Balances</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								To keep your account active and avoid service interruptions, you must either maintain
								a positive account balance at all times or pay any applicable subscription charges 
								(depending on your service plan). Account balances are not transferable, redeemable
								for cash, or refundable; that is, once you make payment on your account, you are 
								provided a credit on your account that can only be used to pay for our Services 
								during the effective period, which varies depending on your service plan.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;
								Positive account balances are forfeited if they are not used within the effective 
								period specified in your service plan (if you properly replenish your account balance
								during the effective period, the effective period restarts). <strong>If you do not 
								use your account balance during the effective period, your account balance will expire 
								and you will not be entitled to a refund or service credit. </strong>Your Service will 
								be interrupted if you fail to maintain a positive account balance or timely pay applicable
								subscription charges for each effective period. When this service interruption occurs, 
								you will be given a period of time (which varies depending on your service plan) 
								to make any appropriate payments on your account. <strong>If you do not make such 
								payments within this time period, your account will be cancelled. If your account 
								is cancelled, you will lose any phone number, identification number, or email 
								address associated with your account. Reactivation fees will apply if you choose 
								to restart Service after cancellation. </strong>There may be limits over which your 
								account balance may not exceed. See the detailed plan or other information we provide 
								or refer you to during the sales transaction (also available at <a href="">boostmobile.com</a>) 
								for the account status rules that apply to your Service. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Switching between Service Plans</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								Unless otherwise provided in the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to 
								during the sales transaction, you may switch to any current service plan. If you switch service
								plans, you may not receive a refund of any portion of any previously paid service charges and 
								you may lose all of your remaining unused minutes, messages, and data allotment. Some service 
								plans are available only on certain phones. Check boostmobile.com for details and options. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">No Refunds of Re-Boost and Monthly Charges </h2> 
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								We are not responsible for, nor do we refund, lost, stolen, misused, or damaged Re-Boost cards. 
								We do not accept returns of or provide refunds for Re-Boost cards. Please ask your retailer 
								any questions regarding its return policy. Re-Boost cards must be applied to your account 
								within the time specified on the card. All Re-Boost sales are final and non-refundable 
								regardless of who uses or possesses your mobile phone or Device after you purchase 
								services, and regardless of whether the mobile phone or Device is used with your consent 
								or knowledge.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Establishing or Replenishing Account Balances</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								Information on how you can establish and maintain an account balance will be provided 
								at activation and is also available at boostmobile.com or through Boost Customer Care. 
								The replenishment methods available to you will depend on the terms of your Services. 
								A fee may apply to certain replenishment methods. Some service plans may provide for 
								automatic account balance replenishment through, for example, automatic billing to a 
								credit card or debit card or automatic debit from an eligible account with a financial 
								institution. Payment through these methods may be subject to limitations, including, 
								but not limited to, the number of times an account may be debited or charged in a particular 
								time period; the amount that may be debited or charged from an account; or other limitations 
								imposed by us or the financial institution that holds the account.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Protecting Our Networks &amp; Services</h2> 
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								We can take any action to: (1) protect our networks, our rights and interests, or 
								the rights of others; or (2) optimize or improve the overall use of our networks and 
								Services. Some of these actions may interrupt or prevent legitimate communications 
								and usage<strong>—</strong>for example, message filtering/blocking software to prevent
								spam or viruses; limiting throughput; limiting access to certain websites, applications 
								or other Data Content; prohibitions on unintended uses (for example, use as a dedicated 
								line or use as a monitoring service); etc. For additional information on what we do to 
								protect our customers, networks, Services and equipment, see our Acceptable Use Policy
								and Visitors Agreement at our website. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Your Privacy</h2> 
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								Our Privacy Policy is available at boostmobile.com/privacy. This policy may change 
								from time to time, so review it with regularity and care. 
							</p> 
							<p>
								<strong>Call Monitoring:</strong> To ensure the quality of our Services and 
								for other lawful purposes, we may monitor or record calls you make to us or we 
								make to you (for example, your conversations with our customer service or sales 
								departments).
							</p> 
							<p>
								<strong>Authentication and Contact:</strong> You (the account holder) may password 
								protect your account information by establishing a personal identification number 
								("PIN"). You may also set a backup security question and answer in the event you 
								forget your PIN. You agree to protect your PIN, passwords, and other account access 
								credentials like your backup security question from loss or disclosure. You further 
								agree that Boost may, in our sole discretion, treat any person who presents your credentials 
								that we deem sufficient for account access as you or an authorized user on the account for 
								disclosure of information or changes in Service. You agree that we may contact you for
								Service-related reasons through the contact information that you provide, through the 
								Services or Devices to which you subscribe, or through other available means, including
								text message, email, fax, recorded message, mobile, residential or business phone, or mail.&nbsp;
							</p> 
							<p>
								<strong>CPNI:</strong> As we provide telecommunications products and Services to you 
								(the account holder), we develop information about the quantity, technical configuration,
								type, location, and destination of telecommunications products and Services you use, as 
								well as some other information found on your bill ("CPNI"). Under federal law, you have 
								the right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI. For example,
								we implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI, including authentication
								procedures when you contact us. For some accounts with a dedicated Boost representative,
								we may rely on contacting your pre-established point of contact as the standard authentication measure.
							</p> 
							
							<p>
								<strong>Third-Party Applications:</strong> If you use a third-party application, the application
								may access, collect, use, or disclose your personal information or require Boost to disclose 
								your information<strong>—</strong>including location information (when applicable)
								<strong>—</strong>to the application provider or some other third party. If you access, 
								use, or authorize third-party applications through the Services, you agree and authorize 
								Boost to provide information related to your use of the Services or the application(s). 
								You understand that your use of third-party applications is subject to the third party's 
								terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. Be sure that you have 
								reviewed and are comfortable with the third party's policies before using its application on your device.
							</p> 
							
							<p>
								<strong>Information on Devices:</strong> Your Device may contain sensitive or personal 
								information (for example, pictures, videos, passwords, or stored credit card numbers). 
								Boost is not responsible for any information on your Device, including sensitive or 
								personal information. If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive 
								or personal information when your Device is out of your possession or control, for example,
								when you relinquish, exchange, return, or recycle your Device. By submitting your Device to 
								us, you agree that our employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information 
								on your Device. If you exchange, return, or recycle your Device through us, we typically 
								attempt to erase all data on your Device, but you must remove all data from your Device 
								before you provide it to us.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Location-Enabled Services </h2> 
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								Our networks generally know the location of your Device when it is outdoors and/or turned on.
								By using various technologies to locate your Device, we can provide enhanced emergency 911 
								services and optional location-enabled services provided by us or a third party. Network 
								coverage or environmental factors (such as structures, buildings, weather, geography, 
								landscape, and topography) can significantly impact the ability to access your Device's 
								location information and use of location-enabled services.&nbsp; <strong></strong>
							</p> 
							
							<p>
								You agree that any authorized user may access, use, or authorize Boost or third-party
								location-enabled applications through the Services. You understand that your use of
								such location-enabled applications is subject to the application's terms and conditions
								and policies, including its privacy policy. If you activate location-enabled services 
								for devices used by other authorized users, you agree to inform the authorized user(s)
								of the terms of use for location-enabled applications and that the Device may be located. &nbsp;
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">911 Or Other Emergency Calls</h2> 
							<p></p>
							<p> 
								<strong>Public safety officials advise that when making 911 or other emergency calls, 
								you should always be prepared to provide your location information.</strong> Unlike 
								traditional wireline phones, depending on a number of factors (for example, whether 
								your Device is GPS-enabled, where you are, whether local emergency service providers
								have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know your phone number, 
								your location, or the location of your Device. In certain circumstances, an emergency 
								call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local 
								emergency service providers. Enhanced 911 service ("E911")<strong>—</strong>where 
								enabled by local emergency authorities<strong>—</strong>uses GPS technology to provide
								location information. Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide 
								accurate location information. If your Device is indoors or for some other reason 
								cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located. Some Devices have a safety 
								feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911<strong>—</strong>you should 
								follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing 
								interactive voice response systems to screen calls.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen</h2>
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen so we can freeze your account. 
								You may be responsible for usage charges before you notify us of the alleged loss or theft.
								You agree to cooperate if we choose to investigate the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.).
								We may not credit or refund any account balance if you choose to terminate Services as
								a result of loss or theft of your Device. If you do not either activate a new device 
								or notify us that you have found your Device within 60 days from the date we froze 
								your account, your account will be deactivated, we may assess a charge equal to the 
								balance in your account (which is not refundable), and, if applicable, you will lose 
								your phone number.
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Disclaimer of Warranties </h2> 
							<p>
								UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN WRITING OTHERWISE, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES,
								EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
								MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE CONCERNING YOUR 
								SERVICES (INCLUDING YOUR DEVICE AND ANY SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS ON YOUR DEVICE). 
								WE DON’T PROMISE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICES AND DON’T AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO
								MAKE WARRANTIES ON OUR BEHALF. BOOST PROVIDES ALL SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS ON AN “AS IS” 
								BASIS WITH ALL FAULTS, ERRORS, AND DEFECTS. 
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">You Agree That We Are Not Responsible For Certain Problems </h2>
							<p> </p>
							<p>
								You agree that neither we nor our parent, subsidiary, or affiliate companies, 
								nor our vendors, suppliers, or licensors are responsible for any damages, delay, 
								interruption or other failure to perform resulting from: (a) anything done or not 
								done by someone else; (b) providing or failing to provide Services, including, but
								not limited to, deficiencies or problems with a Device or network coverage (for example, 
								dropped, blocked, interrupted Services, etc.); (c) traffic or other accidents, or 
								any health-related claims relating to our Services; (d) Data Content or information
								accessed while using our Services; (e) an interruption or failure in accessing or 
								attempting to access emergency services from a Device, including through 911, 
								Enhanced 911 or otherwise; (f) interrupted, failed, or inaccurate location information 
								services; (g) information or communication that is blocked by a spam filter; (h) 
								damage to your Device or any computer or equipment connected to your Device, or 
								damage to or loss of any information stored on your Device, computer, equipment, 
								or Boost storage space from your use of the Services or from viruses, worms, or 
								downloads of malicious content, materials, data, text, images, video, or audio; or 
								(i) things beyond our control, including acts of God (for example, weather-related 
								phenomena, fire, earthquake, hurricane, etc.), riot, strike, war, terrorism, or 
								government orders or acts. You should implement appropriate safeguards to secure 
								your Device, computer, or equipment and to backup your information stored on each.
								<strong></strong>
							</p> 
							
							<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">You Agree That Our Liability Is Limited - No Consequential Damages</h2> 
							<p>
								TO THE EXTEND ALLOWED BY LAW, OUR LIABILITY FOR MONETARY DAMAGES FOR ANY CLAIMS THAT 
								YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THE PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE 
								SERVICE CHARGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AFFECTED PERIOD. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE 
								LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF
								ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE 
								SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH A DEVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, 
								LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

						<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</h2>
						<p></p> 
						
						<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</h2> 
						<p> </p>
						<p>
							In those rare instances where your concern is not resolved to your satisfaction 
							through calls to our customer care, you and Boost each agree to try to resolve 
							those disputes in good faith after you provide written notice of the dispute as
							set forth below. If the dispute is not resolved, you and Boost agree that the 
							dispute will be resolved through individual binding arbitration or small claims
							court, instead of courts of general jurisdiction.
						</p> 
						
						<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Mandatory Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action</h2> 
						<p> </p><p> <strong>Instead of suing in court, you and Boost agree to arbitrate all Disputes
						(as defined below) on an individual, non-representative, basis. You agree that, by entering 
						into this Agreement, you and Boost are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate 
						in a class action or representative action. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be
						broadly interpreted.</strong>&nbsp; <br> In arbitration, there is no judge or jury. 
						Instead Disputes are decided by a neutral third-party arbitrator in a more informal 
						process than in court. In arbitration, there is limited discovery and the arbitrator's 
						decision is subject to limited review by courts. However, just as a court would, the 
						arbitrator must honor the terms of the Agreement and can award damages and relief, including 
						any attorneys' fees authorized by law.&nbsp; 
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							"Disputes" shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies against
							each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way our Services or the Agreement,
							including, but not limited to, coverage, Devices, billing services and practices, policies, 
							contract practices (including enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, 
							even if the claim arises after Services have terminated. Disputes also include, but are 
							not limited to, claims that: (a) you or an authorized or unauthorized user of the Services 
							or Devices bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; (b) 
							you bring against a third party, such as a retailer or equipment manufacturer, that are 
							based on, relate to, or arise out of in any way our Services or the Agreement; or (c) 
							that Boost brings against you. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in 
							any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Boost, 
							whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims or 
							any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before this Agreement or out of a prior Agreement 
							with Boost; (iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or 
							class member; and/or (iv) claims that arise after the termination of this Agreement.
						</p> 
						
						<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Dispute Notice and Dispute Resolution Period</h2> 
						<p> </p>
						<p>
							Before initiating an arbitration or a small claims matter, you and Boost each agree 
							to first provide to the other a written notice ("Notice of Dispute"), which shall contain:
							(a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information
							; and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought. A Notice of Dispute to Boost should be
							sent to: <em>General Counsel; Arbitration Office; 12502 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mailstop 
							VARESA0202-2C682; Reston, Virginia 20191</em>. Boost will provide a Notice of Dispute to 
							you in accordance with the "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section 
							of this Agreement. Boost will assign a representative to work with you and try to resolve 
							your Dispute to your satisfaction. You and Boost agree to make attempts to resolve the 
							Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration or small claims action. If an agreement cannot 
							be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or Boost may 
							commence an arbitration proceeding or small claims action. 
						</p> 
						
						<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Arbitration Terms, Process, Rules and Procedures</h2> 
						<p> </p>
						<p>
							(1) Unless you and Boost agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a single, 
							neutral arbitrator and will take place in the county of the last billing address of the Service. 
							The arbitration will be governed by either: (a) rules that we mutually agree upon; or (b) the
							JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (the "JAMS Rules"), as modified by this
							agreement to arbitrate, including the rules about the filing, administration, discovery and 
							arbitrator fees. The JAMS rules are available on its website at jamsadr.com. Notwithstanding 
							any JAMS Rule to the contrary or any other provision in arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, 
							to govern the arbitration, we each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to 
							the arbitrator to decide, except that only a court (and not the arbitrator) shall decide any 
							disagreements regarding the scope and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							(2) The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision. 
							We each agree that the FAA's provisions—not state law—govern all questions of whether a Dispute 
							is subject to arbitration. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS
							Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural 
							Fairness (the "Minimum Standards"), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply. However, 
							nothing in this paragraph will require or allow you or Boost to arbitrate on a class-wide, 
							representative or consolidated basis. 
						</p> 
						<p>
							(3) The arbitrator may award declaratory or 
							injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent 
							necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. <strong>YOU AND BOOST 
							AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS
							A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</strong>. Further, unless 
							both you and Boost expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than 
							one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or 
							class proceeding. If any portion of this provision is found to be unenforceable, then the 
							entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
						</p> 
						<p>
							(4) We each are responsible for our respective costs, including our respective counsel, 
							experts, and witnesses. Boost will pay for any filing or case management fees associated 
							with the arbitration and the professional fees for the arbitrator's services. 
						</p> 
						
						<p>
							(5) An arbitrator's award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim 
							and will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions
							which form the basis of the award. The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding,
							with some limited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any 
							court with jurisdiction.
						</p> 
						<p>
							(6) As an alternative to arbitration, we may resolve Disputes in small claims court
							in the county of your most recent billing address. In addition, this arbitration
							agreement does not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any 
							federal, state, or local government agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, 
							seek relief against Boost on your behalf.

					<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">No Trial By Jury and No Class Action</h2> 
					<p></p>
					<p>
						IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY PROCEEDS
						IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS AN ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM 
						OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDING, WE EACH AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THERE WILL NOT 
						BE A JURY TRIAL OR CLASS ACTION AND WE EACH UNCONDITIONALLY (1) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
						AND (2) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS, INCLUDING JOINING A CLAIM WITH

						OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING. 
					</p> 
					
					<h2 class="font-boostneo-gradient">Indemnification</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p> 
						You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Boost and our subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies,
						vendors, suppliers, and licensors harmless from any claims arising out of or relating to your actions,
						including, but not limited to, your use of the Service and any information you submit, post, transmit,
						or make available via the Service; failing to provide appropriate notices regarding location-enabled 
						services (see "Location-Enabled Services" section); failure to safeguard your passwords, backup

						in an instance, we don't waive our right to later enforce that requirement. Except

						and the documents it incorporates make up the entire agreement between us and replaces all
						prior written or spoken agreements<strong>—</strong>you can't rely on any contradictory 
						documents or statements by sales or service representatives. The rights, obligations, 
						and commitments in the Agreement that—by their nature—would logically continue beyond 
						the termination of Services (for example, those relating to billing, payment, 911, 
						dispute resolution, no class action, no jury trial) survive termination of Services.
