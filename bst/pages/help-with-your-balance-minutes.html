					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

You can also log into&nbsp;<a href="https://activate.boostmobile.com/boostApp/accountLogin.do">My Account</a>&nbsp;to view your balance and payment date, plus see a list of account activities.</p>
									<p>NOTE:&nbsp;Some monthly plan customers may only have the ability to view Account Activity for voice calls that resulted in an additional charge to the account, such as International calls.</p>

									<p>It will depend on your plan:
										<br>
										<br> Monthly Plans:&nbsp;Your nationwide service is unlimited, so you can talk, text and browse the web all you want without worrying about how much money or how many minutes you have left in your account. But it is always a good idea to have extra money in your account each month so you can make digital purchases (e.g., ringtones, games)
										<br>
										<br> Daily Unlimited:&nbsp;If your account balance reaches zero, but you've already paid your daily subscription fee, you will still be able to use all the services included in your plan. However, you will not be able to pay for and use additional services not included in your plan, such as. international calls. Please add extra money to your account to pay for these additional services. Once your account reaches a $0 balance, you will have 60 days to add money to your account or your account will be canceled and you will lose your personal telephone number.</p>

									<h2> <a id="when-do-i-have-to-add-money-to-my-account">When do I have to add money to my account?</a> </h2>
									<p> It will depend on your plan:&nbsp;
										<br>
										<br> Monthly Plans:&nbsp;Make sure to add enough money to cover your monthly payment amount to your account by your monthly payment date to avoid service interruption. If you miss a monthly payment, you have 60 days to make your monthly payment and have your service restored; or you can switch to the Daily plan which will allow you to continue using your phone - as long as you have money in your account to pay for any daily recurring charge.
										<br>
										<br> If you go longer than 60 days without making a successful monthly payment, your account will be canceled, you'll forfeit any remaining balance and lose your Boost phone number.&nbsp;
										<br>
										<br> To get your monthly payment date, dial #BAL (#225) from your phone.</p>

									<h2> <a id="does-my-account-ever-expire-or-cancel">Does my account ever expire or cancel?</a> </h2>
									<p>Monthly Plans: If you miss 2 monthly payments in a row (60 days), your account will cancel and you will lose any remaining balance and you'll lose your Boost phone number.</p>

									<p>Your service will be interrupted.
										<br>
										<br> Monthly Plans:&nbsp;You'll need to add enough money to cover the cost of your monthly plan in order to restore your service. Once you make a successful payment, your monthly payment date will change to the day of the month before the date you restore services. For example, if you restore services on the 15th your payment date will be on the 14th going forward.
										<br>
										<br> If you don't think you'll have enough to cover the monthly payment, you should consider switching to our Daily Unlimited plan which will allow you to continue using your phone for $2 or $3 per day.&nbsp;
										<br>
										<br> Daily Unlimited:&nbsp;If you don't have enough money to cover your daily subscription fee, your service will be interrupted until you add money to your account. If you add money in the middle of a day that your daily subscription has not already been paid, you will receive the benefits of the plan for the remainder of that day until 12:01 am (based on your time zone), when you will be charged the daily rate for the next day.</p>

									<p>Make sure you check for any account activity in&nbsp;<a href="https://activate.boostmobile.com/boostApp/myAccount.do">My Account</a>. You may have made a purchase that hit your account balance between the time you added your money and the time we attempted to withdraw the payment.</p>

									<p>If you're set up on Auto Re-Boost™, the entire cost of your monthly plan is automatically charged to your credit or debit card each month.
