				<h3 class="black">What is Boost Premier 14 Day Grace Period?</h3>
				<br />
				<br />
				<p style="font-family: Boost_bold;font-size: 17px;">
					A payment grace period is an amount of time youâ€™re allowed to make a payment past its original due date. With the Boost Premier 14 Days Grace Period program, you have the flexibility to make your monthly payment up to 14 days past the due date without having your service interrupted. It is not 14 days of free service. Think of it only as a safety net. Your payment is still due the same day each month, but we won't shut off your service for up to 14 days as long as you pay within that 14 day window.<br />
					<br />Also as a Boost Premier member you'll also continue receiving <b style="font-family: Boost_black">free incoming calls and text messages</b> even if you haven't paid. <b>For up to 60 days</b>.
				</p>
				<h3 class="sign-up">You deserve to be a <b style="font-family: Boost_black">Boost Premier</b> member. <b class="b-bold">Sign up today.</b></h3>

					*Not available at boostmobile.com or national retailers.
Program includes a 14 Day payment "Grace Period". <b>Grace Period</b>: Customer's payment due date does not change, but customer can opt in to receive an additional 14 days each month to pay for recurring service and add-on charges only ("Grace Period"). Must meet certain eligibility requirements. Standard payment terms and conditions still apply and customer will be suspended on or after the Grace Period if a payment is not made. Funds must be added to the account for other real-time purchases (e.g., games, international calls, etc.). Customer will have a payment Grace Period each month unless they elect to convert back to the standard prepaid payment model or if Boost terminates customer's enrollment (detailed below).
If customer does not make payment within their Grace Period, their services will be interrupted; repeated service interruptions may result in customer's termination from the program. Upon payment to resume services, customer's payment due date will reset to the calendar date payment was made minus 14 days. Boost Mobile reserves the rights to pursue collections for any delinquent debits not paid within a reasonable timeframe. <b>Free Incoming Calls & Texts</b>: Avail, for monthly plan subscribers only for 60 days from last payment due date. Not avail. For customers who have not paid for at least one month or if account is cancelled.
Includes inbound domestic voice and SMS only. Excludes outbound SMS and voice calling, multimedia messages, inbound calls received in roaming territories.
<b>Other Terms</b>: Boost reserves the right to modify, extend or cancel offer at any time. Prohibited network use rules apply & other restrictions apply - see <a style="color:#999" href="https://www.boostmobile.com/#!/about/legal/">boostmobile.com/about/legal</a> for details.
