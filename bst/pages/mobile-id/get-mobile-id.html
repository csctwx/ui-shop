You can easily switch from one ID Pack to another without losing any applications you've already downloaded and installed.</p>

											<div class="infoPanel"> 
												<dl> 
													<dt><span></span>How much time will it take to download the ID pack?</dt> 
													<dd>This is based on the size of the ID pack. The average pack downloads and installs in less than a few minutes.</dd> 
													<dt><span></span>How many ID packs can I have at a time? </dt> 
													<dd> Your phone is limited to 6 packs (5 plus My ID) at any given time. If you attempt to install a 7th ID Pack the following message will appear: "You have filled all available ID Pack slots. To add a new ID pack you must delete an existing one. Tap Manage to see a list of your installed ID Packs and choose one to delete." </dd> 
													<dt><span></span>How much do ID packs cost?</dt>

Boost will help a customer to determine if their issue is directly related to the 3rd party ID Pack (vs. the ID Pack installation/download).</dd> 
													<dt><span></span>Where can I find the 3rd party contact info?</dt>

													<dt><span></span>How will I be notified of updates/upgrades to an ID Pack?</dt> 
													<dd>Currently there are no Boost notifications for updates to ID Packs or individual applications. 3rd Party ID Pack developers might notify you if you sign up for their notifications through the 3rd party developer site.

													<dt><span></span>Will the ID Packs have different menus, screens, etc? </dt>

													<dt><span></span>Will Boost maintain a history or backup of each customer's ID Packs installed? </dt> 
													<dd>No. We don't track or manage your installation and removal of an ID pack. You are free to install and delete any pack you like. The only pack that must remain on your phone is the Boost ID pack. </dd> 
													<dt><span></span>What is "My ID"?</dt> <dd>My ID is a permanent, pre-loaded ID Pack on Mobile ID devices that is fully customizable by you. </dd> 
													<dt><span></span>Can I opt out of using Mobile ID?</dt> 
													<dd>To enjoy the full benefit of being a Boost Mobile customer, you are encouraged to download and use any pack you desire. You should have at least the Boost ID Pack installed on the device at all times. You can choose to only use the My ID pack and not install Boost ID Pack if you so desire.</dd> 
													<dt><span></span>Can I add ID Packs to any device?</dt> 
													<dd>No. Mobile ID is only available on Mobile ID devices. Currently there is one Mobile ID device: Samsung Transform</dd>

													<dd>ID Packs must be re-installed/downloaded following a device reset or replacement.</dd> 
													<dt><span></span>Can I review a history of ID Packs I have downloaded?</dt> 
													<dd>No we don't track or maintain a history of your ID pack downloads. </dd> 
													<dt><span></span>Does this approach "fracture/split" the Android Code?</dt> 
													<dd>Absolutely not. Boost believes we must maintain the integrity of Android, and not allow the fracturing of the Operating system. Mobile ID places an application on top of Android that allows the content and developer community to place their experience in front of their customers at the point of activation. Any application built for Mobile ID can be placed into the market and used by any other carrier.</dd>
