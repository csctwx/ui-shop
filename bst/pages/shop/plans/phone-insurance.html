					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

								<ul> 
									<li>
										Without insurance, you may be required to pay full price for a new phone if a replacement is needed.
									</li> 
									<li>
										Insuring your phone provides you peace of mind by protecting your investment in the event of loss, 
										theft, accidental damage, and out- of-warranty mechanical or electrical breakdown.
									</li> 
									<li>
										Select smartphones get the added protection of Gadget Guardian™ powered by Lookout®. 
										This app allows you to locate, lock or wipe your smartphone if it becomes lost or stolen.
									</li> 
									<li>
										It's easy and convenient.
									</li> 
									<li>
										You can typically receive a replacement phone as early as the next business day, 
										once your claim is approved.
									</li>
