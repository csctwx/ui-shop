Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage.

									<p>
										This program provides two great benefits to loyal Boost Mobile customers who are on monthly unlimited plans: 1) a <u>14 Day Payment Grace Period</u> and 2) <u>free incoming calls and incoming text messages even if you haven’t paid.</u>
									</p>
									<ol> 
										<li>
											<strong>14 Day Payment Grace Period:</strong> The 14 Day Payment Grace Period provides the flexibility to pay your monthly payment up to 14 days late without having your service interrupted.
											<ul type="circle"> 
												<li>
													<strong>Note:</strong> We recommend you always try to make your monthly payments on time – even if you have the 14 Day Payment Grace Period. That way, you won’t risk running past your Grace Period and having your service interrupted.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Free incoming calls/texts even if you haven’t paid for 60 days:</strong> If you miss making your payment within the 14 days, you will still be able to receive incoming domestic calls and incoming texts (SMS only) for up to 60 days from your last payment date even if your service has been interrupted (MMS, data, outgoing calls or texts except 911/611 are excluded).

									<h2> 
										<a id="what_is_the_14_pay_payment_grace_period">What is the 14 Day Payment Grace Period?</a> 
									</h2> 
									<p>
										 A Payment Grace Period is an amount of time you’re allowed to make a payment past its original due date. With the Boost Premier program, you have the flexibility to make your monthly payment up to 14 days past the due date without having your service interrupted.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong><u>This is not 14 days of free service.</u></strong> 
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Think of it <u>only</u> as a safety net.</strong> Your payment is still due the same day each month, but we won’t shut off your service for up to 14 days as long as you pay within that 14 day window.
									</p>	
									<p>
										Here’s an example:
									</p>
									<ul>
										Let’s say your monthly payment is due <strong>today</strong> and your new month of service begins <strong>tomorrow</strong>. If you can’t make your payment today, that’s okay! Thanks to the Payment Grace Period, your new month of service will begin tomorrow – just like usual. You can keep using your service without interruption as long as you make a payment <strong>within the next 14 days.</strong>
									</ul>
									<p>
										Keep in mind that the Payment Grace Period will not change when your next monthly payment is due. So if you wait the full 14 days to pay after your monthly due date, your next monthly payment will be due in as little as two weeks. That’s why <strong>it’s always best to make your payments on time.</strong>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>Note:</strong> Full program terms and conditions further below.

									</h2> 
									<p>
										It can take up to 5 business days for your enrollment to be processed. So if your new month of service is set to start in the upcoming week, please make your upcoming payment on time to prevent your service from being interrupted.

									</h2> 
									<p>
										 Your monthly payments are still due on the same day at the beginning of each month. If something happens and you can’t make your payment on time, the program provides an additional 14 days to pay. If you are unable to make your payment within the additional 14 days, your service will be interrupted. 
									</p>
									
									<p>
										<strong>Here’s an example of how the Payment Grace Period works:</strong>
									</p>
									
									<p>
										Let’s say your monthly payment is due on July 31 and your new month of service begins on August 1…
									</p>
									
									<ul>
										<strong>Payment made on or before monthly due date:</strong> You make your payment on or before July 31. Your new month of service begins August 1 without interruption. Your next monthly payment will be due August 31.
									</ul>
									
									<ul>
										<strong>Payment made after monthly due date but within Grace Period:</strong>  You miss your payment on July 31. Thanks to your Payment Grace Period, your new month of service automatically begins August 1 without interruption. You make your payment by August 14 (within the 14 day Payment Grace Period!) so your service isn’t interrupted. Your next monthly payment will be due August 31.
									</ul>

									<ul>
										<strong>Note:</strong>   If a payment is made before the Grace Period window it will not be held for Advance Payment. These funds will remain in your account balance. This means any actions that incur a charge will deduct funds from that available balance. If a payment is made within the Grace Period window it will be held until the Grace Period end date and applied then.
									</ul>
									
									<ul>
										<strong>Payment made after Grace Period end date:</strong>  You miss your payment on July 31. Thanks to your Payment Grace Period, your new month of service automatically begins August 1. If you still don’t make your payment by August 14, the Grace Period end date, then your service will now be interrupted as of August 15.
									</ul>
									
									<ul>
										You will need to make your payment to resume service. Payments can be made via any self-service channel.
									</ul>
									
									<ul>
										If you made your payment to resume service on August 16, your new monthly due date will be September 2, and your Grace Period end date will now be September 16. 
									</ul>
									
									<ul>
										
											<ul type="disc">
												<li>
													<strong>Note:</strong>  during the 1 day of interrupted service you will still continue to receive free incoming calls and incoming SMS text messages. 
												</li>
												<li>
													<strong>Note:</strong> Repeated service interruptions may lead to dismissal from the program 
												</li>

										<a id="what_happens_if_i_make_a_payment_past_my_grace_period_end_date">What happens if I make a payment past my Grace Period end date?</a> 
									</h2> 
									<p>
										If you do not make a payment before your Grace Period end date your service will be interrupted. You will need to make a payment to resume service. Upon making your payment to resume service, your new payment due date will reset to the calendar day payment was made minus 14 days.
									</p>

									<h2> 
										<a id="how_do_the_free_incoming_calls_and_incoming_text_messages_work">How do the Free Incoming Calls and Incoming Text Messages work?</a> 
									</h2> 
									<p>
										It’s simple. You’ll receive free incoming domestic calls and incoming text messages for up to 60 days even if your service has been interrupted because you haven’t made your monthly payment. You will not be able to make any outgoing calls (except 911/611 calls), send any text message, or be able to use any data during this time.  This is our way of keeping you connected until you can pay your monthly charge. This benefit is included free of charge with Boost monthly plans.

									<h2> 
										<a id="when_is_my_auto_payment_charged_with_grace_period">When is my Auto Payment charged with Grace Period?</a> 
									</h2> 
									<p>
										We'll charge your Auto Payment method for the full month of service plus any applicable taxes and surcharges <strong>on your Grace Period end date.</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, let’s say your monthly payment is due on July 31 and your new month of service begins on August 1. Your credit/debit card will be charged in 14 days from your month end date on August 14.

									<p>
										Yes, you can change plans when enrolled in this program. But you may have to make a payment with your plan change. And the 14 Day Grace Period may not apply to your first monthly payment with the new monthly plan.

You will also receive new payment reminders via email that will include both your monthly due date and the Grace Period end date. These will also be sent to you before your monthly due date, and before your Grace Period end date.
