Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

										That’s easy – Family Plans offer flexibility, additional savings, and convenience!  
										<br /><br />
										Flexibility – Mix and match a Family Plan in a way that suits each individual needs of the family.  Now, each individual can pick the plan with the amount of high-speed data that works best for them - some may want more high-speed data, some may want less.  
										<br /><br />
										Savings – Boost offers more savings by combining individual plans into one Family Plan.  The more lines that are added, the greater the discount.   Use the <a href="/shop/plans/family-plans/calculator">Savings Plan Calculator</a> to determine your Family Plan discount and monthly payment amount.  
										<br /><br />
										Convenience – What’s more convenient than one monthly payment for all members of a Boost Family Plan?  Plus Boost Family Plans have all of the features found on our single line plans:
										<br /><br />
										<ul>
											<li>	Unlimited Data, Talk & Text, with different allotments of high-speed data for each <a href="https://www.boostmobile.com/#!/shop/plans/family-plans/">plan</a></li>
											<li>	Domestic voice roaming (up to 50 minutes per month) extending your voice coverage area to 99% coverage nationwide</li>
											<li>	<a href="https://www.boostmobile.com/#!/shop/plans/data-free-music/">Unlimited Music Streaming</a> without data charges (select partners)</li>
											<li>	Ability to turn your phone into a Wi-Fi Hotspot (data usage is drawn from your plan’s high-speed data allotment on the $35/$45 plans and a maximum 8GB of high-speed data on the $60 plan.)</li>
											<li>	Free incoming calls and text messages even if you have not paid; for up to 60 days</li>
											<li>	$5 Auto Re-Boost<sup>SM</sup> discount on the primary line of the Family Plan if registered for Auto Re-Boost<sup>SM</sup>.</li>
										</ul>
										<br /><br />
										Note: Our Family plans do not include Growing Data or Grace Period.
										<br /><br />
										Boost’s Single Line Plans offer the added value of Growing Data in addition to the plan features above. <br />

										<a id="can-I-get-the-discount-benefit">Can I get the discount benefit of the $5 Auto Re-Boost<sup>SM</sup> on Family Plans?</a>

									<p>
										Yes, Boost offers a $5 discount only for the primary account holder of the Family Plan who registers for Auto Re-Boost<sup>SM</sup>.  The discount will not apply to any secondary lines.

									<h2> 
										<a id="what-happens-if-someone-leaves-the-family">What happens if someone leaves the family?</a> 
									</h2> 
									<p>
										It depends on who leaves: 
									</p> 
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>If the primary account holder leaves</strong>, the service of all the secondary lines will continue uninterrupted until the next monthly payment due date for the family.   At that time a secondary line may want to either takeover as the primary line for the family and assume the payment responsibility for all lines, or make a plan change to a Single Line Plan.  Either way, payment on the plan will be required by each secondary subscribers in order for service to continue the next month.  In order to ensure your service is uninterrupted, we suggest you schedule a plan change for your next monthly payment date in <a href="https://myaccount.boostmobile.com/">My Account</a> so you get the full benefit of services already been paid.  Boost will not be able to transfer any unused account balance of the primary account holder to the secondary lines. 
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>If a secondary account holder leaves</strong>, we will automatically recalculate the total monthly amount due by the primary account holder on the next monthly payment date.  Since the Family Plan discount is based on the total number of lines in your family, the primary line will see a decrease in the Family Plan discount amount.  We will adjust the next monthly payment amount to reflect the total monthly cost of the lines still in your family.  Unused service will <u>not</u> be credited back to the primary line in this event.  We think you will like the benefits of our Family Plan, but if you find yourself as a single payer, we suggest you consider switching back to one of our Single Line Plans with the added benefit of Growing Data for our $35/$45 plans.<br />

									<p>
										It varies slightly based on each customer’s situation but this credit only applies to existing Boost customers who are joining an existing Family Plan group.  
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>If you are new to Boost</strong> and creating a family group as the primary line, you will owe a full month’s payment for the Family Plan you select.

									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>An existing Boost Single Line customer who is joining a Family Plan as a primary line</strong>, has a choice to change to a family plan immediately and lose any remaining airtime for that month.  Another option is to set up the plan change to a Family plan to occur with the next monthly payment in <a href="https://myaccount.boostmobile.com/">My Account</a> so you can use the remaining portion of their Single Line Plan service before paying for a new month on a Family Plan. 
									</p>
									<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
										<strong>An existing Boost Single Line customer who is joining a Family Plan as a secondary line</strong> (not assuming the payment responsibility) AND has already paid for the current month, you will receive a prorated credit of unused service based on the date you paid the last MRC / 30, times multiplied by the number of days left until the primary line’s next monthly payment date.  This will be applied to primary line’s account balance.  We will align your monthly payment date to match the monthly payment date of the primary line at this time.

										The primary line is responsible for paying for additional monthly recurring services for all lines in the family group including monthly recurring services purchased by individual secondary lines.  One-time, non-recurring purchases are to be paid directly by the individual adding them to his/her account, and will not roll up to the primary account holder, unless he/she is the one adding them.  None of these services are prorated if they are added mid-month.

									</h2> 
									<p>
										Yes, just like our Single Line Plans, you can turn your phone into a Wi-Fi Hotspot. Data usage is drawn from your plan’s high-speed data allotment on the $35/$45 plans and a maximum of 8GB of high-speed data on the $60 plan.<br />
