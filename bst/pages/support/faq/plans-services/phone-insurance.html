					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

									<p> Without insurance, you may be required to pay FULL PRICE for a new phone, if a replacement is needed.</p>
									<ul type="disc">
										<li  class="vignettes">Insuring your phone provides you peace of mind by protecting your phone in the event of loss, theft, accidental damage, and out-of-warranty mechanical or electrical breakdown.</li>

										<li  class="vignettes">Your replacement phone is typically shipped within the next business day, once your claim is approved!</li>
									</ul>
									<p>For $7.00 per month you are covered if your phone is lost, stolen, accidentally damaged - even with liquid, or has an out-of-warranty mechanical or electrical breakdown. Boost Mobile Phone Insurance covers any standard accessories included with the original purchase of the technology.&nbsp;
										<br>
										<br> Upon filing a claim, you will have to pay a nonrefundable deductible of $20, $50, $100 or $175 per approved claim based on your phone. You are eligible for 2 approved claims within a 12-month period beginning on the date of the first replacement. There is a per claim limit of $1,500 inclusive of accessories. Visit <a href="http://myphoneguardian.com/boostmobile">myphoneguardian.com/boostmobile</a> to look up your deductible.</p>

									<h2> <a id="how-do-i-file-a-claim">How do I file a claim?</a> </h2>
									<p>Visit <a href="http://myphoneguardian.com/boostmobile">myphoneguardian.com/boostmobile</a> 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to file a claim with eSecuritel (See Provider Information in&nbsp;brochure). You may also call 1-844-534-3099 from 6AM - 11PM CST, 7 days a week. You should be the primary account holder on the account and report the claim within 30 days of the incident, unless otherwise required by state law. If the approved claim involves a damaged or malfunctioning phone, you will be provided with detailed information on how to return the phone. If the phone is not returned within 10 days after receiving your replacement, you will be charged an unrecovered equipment fee up to $200.</p>

									<h2> <a id="how-long-does-it-take-to-get-a-replacement-phone-once-i-file-a-claim">How long does it take to get a replacement phone once I file a claim?</a> </h2>
									<p>Once your claim is approved, you have provided any necessary documentation, and have paid your deductible, your replacement phone will be shipped to an address of your choice. If the claim is approved, you have provided the necessary documents, and you have paid your deductible by 11pm CT Monday through Friday and Saturday 7:30pm CT, you may receive your device the next business day.</p>

									<h2> <a id="what-if-i-dont-have-enough-money-in-my-account-to-pay-for-phone-insurance">What if I don't have enough money in my account to pay for Phone Insurance?</a> </h2>
									<p>If you don't have enough money on your account to pay for both your service plan and your Phone Insurance, your service will become interrupted until you successfully make a payment. That means you won't be able to use your phone and will not have Phone Insurance coverage until you make a payment that covers your monthly payment amount and your Phone Insurance premium.
										<br>
										<br> For example, if you are a monthly plan customer who pays $45 a month and you also have Phone Insurance for $7 a month, your monthly payment is $52. If you don't have $52 in your account when your monthly payment date arrives, your service will be interrupted and you will not have Phone Insurance coverage.</p>

									<p>You can cancel Phone Insurance by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://activate.boostmobile.com/boostApp/myAccount.do">My Account</a>&nbsp;at BoostMobile.com. If you cancel between monthly billing cycles, you will receive a prorated refund or credit for any unearned premium.</p>
