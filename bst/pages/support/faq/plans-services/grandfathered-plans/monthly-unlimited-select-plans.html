					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

										<p>
											We’ve got your back here!  If you miss a payment, we will allow you to receive free domestic calls and SMS (text messages) for 60 days from your last payment due date.  Your account cannot be cancelled and you must have paid for at least one month of service in order to receive the free calls and texts. Until you pay for your service, you will not be able to make any outbound calls, texts or use data services.  (<a href="#!/support/faq/plans-services/free-incoming-calls-sms/">Learn more here</a>).  Your outbound service will be interrupted until you add enough money to your account to cover your monthly payment amount. Once service is restored, your monthly payment date will change to one day prior to the date that service was restored (e.g., if your service is restored on February 15th, your monthly payment date will be reset to March 14th). Restoring service at the end of or on the first of the month (i.e., 30th, 31st or 1st) will result in varied payment dates contingent on the last calendar day of the month.
											<br> <br> 
											You have 60 days to resume service by paying your monthly payment in full or your account will be cancelled and you will lose all funds in your account balance and your phone number.
