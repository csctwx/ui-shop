					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

In addition, Boost may adjust periodically the applicable threshold for Boost's QoS practices. See <a href="#!/framework_network_management/">boostmobile.com/networkmanagement</a> for additional details.</p> </div> <div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="how-will-i-know-if-im-impacted-by-the-network-quality-of-service-policy">How will I know if I'm impacted by the Network Quality of Service policy?</a> </h2> <p>We will send you a free text message notifying you that you have used 75% of the 23GB allowed so you can adjust your data usage. </p> <p>In the event you reach 23GBs, we will send you a second free text message notifying you that you may experience reduced network performance for the remainder of the payment cycle during times of network congestion. </p> </div> <div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="what-is-data-speed-reduction">What is data speed reduction?</a> </h2> <p>Boost plans offer varying allotments of high-speed data based on the plan. Once the plan's applicable high-speed allotment has been depleted, network data access will continue but data speeds will be slowed to 2G speeds for the remainder of the plan's billing cycle. During this time, you may experience longer load times for certain web pages and downloads as well as a degraded streaming experience from some content providers and/or applications. Your data speeds will be restored at the beginning of your next plan cycle. If you can't wait, you can restore your high-speed data by, (1) restarting your plan or (2) purchasing a Data Pack (select monthly plans only).</p> </div> <div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="what-are-sprints-normal-unrestricted-network-data-speeds">What are Sprint's normal unrestricted network data speeds?</a> </h2> <p>Network data speeds vary based on a combination of factors, such as location and environmental factors, coverage (network and signal strength), and device compatibility. For Sprint's 3G data network, the average downlink data speeds range between 600 and 1400 Kbps. For Sprint's LTE data network speeds range on average between 3 - 4 Mbps.</p> </div> <div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="but-how-can-you-call-this-unlimited-when-you-are-restricting-speeds">But how can you call this unlimited when you are restricting speeds?</a> </h2> <p>There is no cap on the amount of data you use, nor do we charge for any quantity of data usage above any particular amount. We are simply reducing the throughput data speeds only when a customer depletes their plan's applicable high-speed data allotment. We are still providing our customers with unlimited data access and no data overage charges, and it's likely that the vast majority of our customers won't reach their threshold, given current usage reports.</p> </div> <div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="will-it-affect-me">Will it affect me?</a> </h2> <p>It depends. First, keep in mind that we offer a variety of plans with different high-speed data allotments, starting at 1GB a month, up to 10GB a month. How much you need depends on your usage. To illustrate, 2.5GB of monthly data is approximately 400,000 Mobile Internet page views, about 90,000 emails (without attachments), 91 hours of streaming music or 20 hours of video clips, in a month*. Also, this data is measured only when you're using your device while on a mobile network, not when connected to a Wi-Fi connection. So pick the plan you estimate what your usage will be and if you find you need more or less data, you can always change your plan since there are no long-term contracts binding you one plan or another.</p> </div> <div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="how-will-i-know-how-much-data-ive-used">How will I know how much data I've used?</a> </h2> <p>You will receive warning notifications via text message. First, when you reach 85% of your plan's applicable high-speed data allotment. And then, once you've depleted your high-speed data. You can also view/monitor your total data usage for the month by visiting <a href="https://activate.boostmobile.com/boostApp/accountLogin.do">My Account</a> at boostmobile.com.</p> </div> <div class="faq-answer-sub"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="what-happens-once-ive-slowed">What happens once I've slowed?</a> </h2> <p>You will continue to have data access but your data speeds will be slowed to 2G speeds for the remainder of your plan cycle. Again, if you can't wait, you can use the <a href="#!/support/faq/plans-services/plan-restart/">Restart Plan</a> option and make your full monthly payment early to re-enable all your services immediately by visiting <a href="https://activate.boostmobile.com/boostApp/accountLogin.do">My Account</a>. You can also purchase a Data Pack for an additional allotment of high-speed data.<br><br>This may result in slower webpage loads, file downloads and streaming media.** High speed data access will return at the beginning of your next monthly plan cycle. However, even if data is slowed, this will not impact or affect your ability to make phone calls or send text messages from your phone.<br><br>Please visit <a href="#!/">www.boostmobile.com</a> for additional details and our full terms and conditions.</p> <p>*Measured data usage per activity is based on an average consumption and usage.
