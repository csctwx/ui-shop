					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

                                 <hr>
								 <p>With our Monthly Unlimited Plans with Growing Data, you can earn 500MB of extra high-speed monthly data after every 3 on-time payments. Up to 3GB after 18 on-time payments.  </p>

								 <table width="80%">

								 		</tr>
								 	</tbody>
								 </table>

								 <p>All of these monthly plans include:</p>

								<ul class="bulleted less-padding"> <li><strong>Unlimited Talk, Text and Data</strong> - Unlimited domestic talk, text (including text, picture and video messaging), and data (at applicable 3G/4G high-speed data allotment).</li>
								<li><strong>Mobile hotspot</strong> - Up to 8GB of data to share with others when you turn your phone into a hotspot when in a coverage area.</li>
								<li><strong>Unlimited music streaming without data charges</strong> - Stream music through your Boost Mobile smartphone without it counting against your high-speed data allotment (<a href="#!/shop/plans/data-free-music/">see our current music partners</a>.)</li>
								<li><strong>Free incoming calls and texts if past due</strong> - Free incoming domestic voice calls and texts for up to 60 days if you are not able to pay (<a href="#!/support/faq/plans-services/free-incoming-calls-sms/">learn more</a>.)</li></ul>
								<p class="i-heading line">How Growing Data Works</p>
<p>After every 3rd on-time payment, we’ll increase your next month’s data allotment by 500MB, up to a total of 3GB. That means if you make 18 on-time payments in a row, you will increase your plan’s data allotment by 3GB. We will send you a free text message whenever we increase your monthly data allotment. </p>
<p class="i-heading line">Phone Upgrades and Plan Changes</p>
<p>If you upgrade your phone, you’ll keep the data you’ve earned on your Growing Data plan. </p>
<p>If you want to change from a $35 plan to a $45 plan, you’ll keep the data you’ve earned. However, if you change from a $45 plan to a $35 plan, you will lose the data rewards you earned while on your $45 plan, and the Growing Data counter will start over when you change to the $35/mo. plan. </p>
<p class="i-heading line">Enroll in Auto Re-Boost<sup>SM</sup>  and get $5 off per month</p>
<p>When you register a credit or debit card on your Boost account and sign up for Monthly Auto Re-Boost, you’ll receive a $5/month discount on the cost of your Growing Data plan. </p>
<p>On your monthly payment date, the entire cost of your monthly plan will be automatically charged to your registered credit or debit card, even if you have money in your account balance.</p>
To enroll in Auto Re-Boost, login to <a href="https://myaccount.boostmobile.com/">My Account</a>:

<ol class="less-padding"><li>After you log in, click on the Payments tab and select the Managed Saved Payment Method link on the right in the box labeled Payment Settings.</li> 
<li>Here you will be able to add your registered credit or debit card and enroll in Auto Re-Boost.</li></ol>
