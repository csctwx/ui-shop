					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

                                 <hr>
								 <p>Boost plans offer varying allotments of high-speed data based on the plan. </p>

								 <table width="80%">
								 	<thead>
								 		<td>Plan</td>
								 		<td>4G LTE High-Speed Data</td>
								 		<td>Grow Your Data</td>
								 	</thead>
								 	<tbody>
								 		<tr>
								 			<td>$35/mo.</td>
								 			<td>2GB</td>
								 			<td>5GB</td>
								 		</tr>
								 		<tr>
								 			<td>$45/mo.</td>
								 			<td>5GB</td>
								 			<td>8GB</td>
								 		</tr>
								 		<tr>
								 			<td>$65/mo.</td>
								 			<td colspan="2" style="text-align: center;">Unlimited</td>
								 		</tr>
								 	</tbody>
								 </table>

								 <p>When you reach 85% of your plan's applicable high-speed data allotment, you will receive warning notifications via text message. And then, once you've depleted your high-speed data. You can also view/monitor your total data usage for the month by visiting My Account at boostmobile.com.</p>
<p>When you deplete your plan’s applicable high-speed data allotment, we reduce the throughput data to 2G speeds for the remainder of your plan’s billing cycle.</p>
<p>There is no cap on the amount of data you use, nor do we charge for any quantity of data usage above any particular amount. We simply reduce the throughput data speeds once you exceed your plan’s high-speed data allotment.</p>
<p>During this time, you may experience longer load times for certain web pages and downloads as well as a degraded streaming experience from some content providers and/or applications. </p>
<p>However, even if data is slowed, this will not impact or affect your ability to make phone calls or send text messages from your phone.</p>
<p>Your data speeds will be restored at the beginning of your next plan cycle. If you can't wait, you can restore your high-speed data by, (1) restarting your plan or (2) purchasing a Data Pack (select monthly plans only).</p>

<p class="i-heading">Plan Restart</p>
<p>You can restart your plan by logging in to <a href="https://myaccount.boostmobile.com/">My Account</a> and clicking the Restart My Plan link in the Service & Usage tab.</p>

<p>By restarting your plan and paying your total monthly payment amount before the payment date, your plan services (and recurring add-ons, if any) will be reset. </p>
<p>For example, if you used your entire monthly high-speed data allotment, a Plan Restart will reset your monthly data allotment and restore your high-speed data services.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, you will lose any unused minutes, messages and/or data. This includes any one-time services or features that you've purchased for the current month.</p>

<p class="i-heading">Data Packs</p>

<p>A data pack is an add-on that allows you to increase the amount of high-speed 3G/4G LTE data you have access to on your monthly plan. </p>
<p>Data packs are available for purchase on all monthly plans that have data enabled (except the $60 Unlimited plan) and all phones but are not supported on Tablets or Wi-Fi Hotspots.</p>

<table width="50%">
								 	<tbody>
								 		<tr>
								 			<td>$5/mo.</td>
								 			<td>1GB 3G/4G Data</td>
								 		</tr>
								 		<tr>
								 			<td>$10/mo. </td>
								 			<td>2GB 3G/4G Data</td>
								 		</tr>
								 	</tbody>
								 </table>

								 <p>You can add a data pack by visiting <a href="https://myaccount.boostmobile.com/">My Account</a></p>

								 <p>Here's how it works:</p>

								 <ul class="bulleted"><li>Add extra high-speed data to your monthly plan via <a href="https://myaccount.boostmobile.com/">My Account</a></li>
								 <li>A data pack is separate from the data included in your monthly service plan. </li>
								 <li>The data in the data pack add-on will be used before the high-speed data in your monthly service plan, should it be available. </li>
								 <li>Use your data pack within 30 days of purchase.</li>
								 <li>Data packs are a one-time purchase. If you use all the data in your data pack before the 30 days are up, you can purchase an additional data pack.</li></ul>

								 <p class="i-heading">How much data do I need? </p>
<p>How much you need depends on your usage.</p>
<p>To give you an example, 2.5GB of monthly data is approximately 400,000 Mobile Internet page views, about 90,000 emails (without attachments), 91 hours of streaming music or 20 hours of video clips, in a month*. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that you will use mobile data when you're using your device while on a mobile network, not when connected to Wi-Fi. </p>
<p>So pick the plan based on what you think your usage will be and if you find you need more or less data, you can always change your plan. With Boost, there are no long-term contracts.</p>

<small>*Measured data usage per activity is based on an average consumption and usage. Actual bandwidth may vary by website, video and email content, or other Internet application.</small>
