					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

							<p>
                            <strong>Terms of service.</strong> Your service with Boost Mobile includes, but is not limited to, the terms of your Boost service plan (including those outlined below and those which may be presented or provided in other materials) and the most recent Boost Mobile General Terms and Conditions of Service available at <a href="#!/framework_terms_and_conditions/">boostmobile.com/about/legal/terms-conditions/</a> (collectively, “Agreement”). Carefully read all of the parts of your Agreement including the MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION and CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION. <br><br> <strong>Activation of Services/Accounts: </strong>Activation of service occurs when sufficient funds are added to your account balance. Service charges are not refunded or prorated if service is terminated or modified before the next payment due date. Unused services, including but not limited to, minutes, messages, and data allotments, expire at the end of each plan cycle or when switching or restarting service plans and are not carried forward. Partial minutes of use are rounded up to the next whole minute. State and local sales taxes and fees may apply when adding funds to accounts. Our services will only work with our devices. Not all services are available with all devices or on all networks. Not all services available on 4G and coverage may default to 3G/1xRTT where 4G is unavailable.&nbsp; <strong>If you voluntarily choose to activate a 4G WiMax device, please be aware that WiMax functionality will no longer be supported as of 11/6/15.</strong> <br><br> <strong>Nature of our Service.</strong> Our rate plans, devices, services and features are not for resale. The primary use of your device must be for domestic purposes and for other purposes outlined in our offers. Domestic means use in the 48 contiguous states, Hawaii, DC, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. <br><br> <strong>Unlimited Use Plans. </strong>Unlimited does not mean unreasonable. If you subscribe to rate plans, services or features that are described as “unlimited”, you should be aware that such unlimited plans are subject to the Prohibited Network Uses detailed below. &nbsp;<br><br> <strong>Prohibited Network Uses.</strong> To ensure that the activities of some users do not impair the ability of our customers to have access to reliable services at reasonable costs, you may not use our services in a manner that is unlawful, infringes on intellectual property rights, or harms or unduly interferes with the use of Sprint’s network or systems. Boost Mobile reserves the right, without notice or limitation, to terminate, end, modify, disconnect or suspend service if an individual engages in any of the prohibited voice or data uses below or if Boost, in its sole discretion, determines action is necessary to protect its wireless networks and/or customers’ service experience from harm or degradation. <strong>Examples of Prohibited Voice Services uses: </strong>Boost voice services are provided solely for live dialogue between, and initiated by, individuals for personal use &amp; as otherwise described in this policy. Voice services may not be used for any other purposes including, but not limited to: conference calling, monitoring services, transmission of broadcasts or recorded material, interconnection to other networks, telemarketing, autodialed calls, other commercial uses or connections that do not consist of live dialogue between two individuals. We will presume certain usage, dialing, or calling patterns indicate that you are not using for your personal use and we reserve the right to suspend, terminate or restrict your services. <strong>Examples of Prohibited Data uses:</strong>&nbsp; Boost data services are intended to be used for web surfing, sending and receiving email, photographs and other similar messaging activities, and the non-continuous streaming of videos, downloading of files or on line gaming. Our data services may not be used to disrupt email use by others using automated or manual routines, including, but not limited to "auto-responders" or cancel bots or other similar routines; to transmit or facilitate any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, telemarketing, promotional materials, "junk mail", unsolicited commercial or bulk email, or fax; or for activities adversely affecting the ability of other people or systems to use either Boost's wireless services or other parties' Internet-based resources, including, but not limited to, "denial of service" (DoS) attacks against another network host or individual user. <br><br> <strong>Quality of Service Practices (QoS):</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>To help protect against the possibility that customers may occupy an unfair share of network resources, unlimited data plan customers who use more than 23GB of data during a payment cycle will be prioritized below other customers for the remainder of their payment cycle, in times and locations where the availability of network resources is constrained. Affected unlimited data plan customers may notice temporary changes in the performance of certain applications when they are on constrained sites as compared to other users especially if such affected users are engaged in data-intensive activities. Performance will return to normal when the cell site is no longer constrained or the customer moves to a non-constrained location. Affected unlimited customers will still be able to enjoy unlimited quantities of data without overage charges or data caps even if their usage exceeds the threshold for Boost’s QoS practices. In addition, Boost may adjust periodically the applicable threshold for Boost’s QoS practices. See <a href="#!/framework_network_management/">boostmobile.com/networkmanagement</a> for additional details.<strong></strong><br><br> <strong>Plan Throughput Limitations and Performance:</strong> With certain plans, throughput data speeds will be slowed when data usage exceeds the selected plan’s applicable data threshold(s). During this time, data access will continue but maximum speeds will be limited to 2G speeds of 128Kbps or below for the remainder of plan cycle, resulting in slower page loads, downloads, and degraded streaming media. Data speeds will be restored at the beginning of a new plan cycle, or after a plan cycle restart. Data usage can be monitored online in ‘MyAccount’. For more information on Boost’s network management tools, policies and other related information, please visit <a href="#!/framework_network_management/"> boostmobile.com/networkmanagement. </a><br><br> <strong>Adding Funds to Your Account:</strong> Funds can be added to accounts using one of Boost's payment methods (e.g., cash, credit, debit and/or replenishment cards). A $3 service convenience fee may be charged for real-time-replenishment (“RTR”) transactions at some retailers. A maximum of $200 per transaction may be added to accounts until the total account balance amount reaches $400. Once $400 maximum account balance limit is reached, no additional funds may be added to the account. An account balance will decrease as services are used, payments are due and/or services not already included with the service plan are used (e.g., international calling, wireless entertainment, mobile content, etc.). Account funds cannot be transferred between Boost accounts nor can they be applied to any other wireless services. Adding funds through Boost customer service may result in processing fees.<br><br> <strong>Adding Funds/Account Balances for Pay As You Go (expired) &amp; Daily Unlimited Plans Only: </strong>Funds must be added to Daily and Pay As You Go accounts <strong><em>once every 90 days</em>,</strong> regardless of usage and balance, or, when the balance is low, in order to keep the account and services active. Otherwise, any remaining account funds will be lost and the account &amp; services will be interrupted. Once an account has a zero balance, additional funds must be added to the account within 60 days to keep the account from being canceled and loss of the telephone number.<br><br> <strong>Payment for Daily Unlimited Plans: </strong>Payments for Daily plans will be deducted from the account every day, regardless of usage, at 12:01 a.m. in the customer's time zone unless the daily plan is cancelled. <br><br> <strong>Payment for Monthly Plans: </strong>Payments for monthly plans are due<strong> </strong>based<strong> </strong>on the date the plan is initially purchased, the restart date, or the last date of the month, if applicable. <strong>Re-Activation Date:</strong> If service is interrupted (i.e., insufficient account funds, missed payments, etc.) and later resumed, the payment due date will change to the date <em>before</em> services were re-activated (i.e., if services are re-activated on the 15th, the next payment will be due on the 14th of the following month and every month thereafter); unless, occurring at the <em>end</em> or <em>first</em> of the month, which will result in varied payment due dates contingent on the last calendar date of each month. <br><br> <strong>Advance Payment (monthly plans only):</strong> When funds are added to an account and the account balance equals or exceeds the monthly payment amount, we reserve the right to automatically deduct the next monthly payment amount from the account balance. Only one monthly payment may be paid in advance. Advance Payment may be cancelled online in My Account, up to one hour before your next monthly payment is due. Advance Payment is not available for all plans. If sufficient funds are not available in advance to make a payment, Boost may process payments using other funding sources available, including, but not limited to, account balance or credit/debit cards for Auto Re-Boost customers.<br><br> <strong>All Plans </strong>must be paid for in-full, with accounts in current status within sixty (60) days of service interruption to resume services or the account will be cancelled. Account cancellation will result in loss of remaining account funds, if any, and loss of the phone number associated with the account. If service is resumed following a cancellation, a reactivation fee may apply. <br><br> <strong>Messaging (text, picture, audio, and video):</strong> Domestic and international messaging rates are subject to change. Standard message rates are charged when a text message or picture/audio/video message (“MMS”) is sent or received, whether read or unread, viewed or unviewed, solicited or unsolicited. There is no guarantee messages will be received and we bear no responsibility for lost or misdirected messages.<br><br> <strong>Off-network Roaming:&nbsp; </strong>The availability of domestic roaming services is dependent on your device and plan. Not all services and plan features (i.e., data, text, etc.) may be available when roaming. Boost reserves the right, without notice, to deny, terminate, modify, disconnect or suspend service. Domestic roaming coverage, services and rates are subject to change at any time without notice.<br><br> <strong>International Roaming:</strong> &nbsp;Accessing service outside of the 50 United States, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico is dependent on your service plan; certain plan services and features (i.e., data, voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, etc.) may not be available in all roaming areas. International calling may not be included in all roaming areas or plans. Boost reserves the right to deny, terminate, modify, disconnect or suspend service if the majority of minutes or kilobytes are used for international roaming. International roaming coverage, services and rates are subject to change at any time without notice, check&nbsp;<a href="#!/shop/plans/international-connect/">boostmobile.com/international</a>&nbsp;for more information.
							
							<br><br> <strong>Plan Add-Ons: </strong>Available only for monthly plans and are valid until the term specified or until the applicable add-on’s service allotment (e.g., dataor minutes) is depleted, whichever occurs first. Recurring add-ons will remain on an account until removed. 

							<!--new content added by Shuman Erin request on 2015/12/11 -->
							<br><br> <strong>Third Party Products and Services. </strong> Boost Mobile devices provide the ability to purchase from Third Parties (not Boost) mobile apps and other digital content/services, tangible goods, and to make donations. Payments for purchased mobile content are deducted from account balance and charges display in the online account. You can block the ability to make such purchases at no add’l cost by calling Customer Care.
