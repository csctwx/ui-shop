					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

									<p>If you're not happy with your service and you would like to cancel your account, all you have to do is walk away. Your Boost Mobile account will cancel on its own.</p>
									<p>Monthly Plans:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're on a monthly plan, your account will cancel after 60 days.</p>
									<p>NOTE: Once your account cancels, you'll lose your Boost phone number. Should you decide to reactivate your phone, you may be subject to a reactivation fee.</p>
