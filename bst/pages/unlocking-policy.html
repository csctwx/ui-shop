Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

									<h2> <a id="what-does-it-mean-for-my-device-to-be-locked">What does it mean for my device to be 'locked'?</a> </h2>
									
									<p>The term “locked” typically refers to a device that can only be used with Boost Mobile on the Sprint network and cannot be activated on a competing carrier’s network.&nbsp; An “unlocked” device is no longer locked to Boost Mobile services and the user may attempt to activate it on another carrier’s network.&nbsp; There are generally two scenarios for device unlocking:</p>
									
									
									
									<!--<ul start="1" type="1">-->
										
										<!--<li><u>MSL Unlocking:</u> A device is ‘locked’ if it is manufactured with a type of disabling software and a locking code (referred to as ‘Master Subsidy Lock’ or ‘MSL’).&nbsp; Generally speaking, for devices launched before February 2015, an MSL was utilized that locks the device to certain operational parameters for use on with Boost Mobile services and prevents the device from attempting to be activated on other carriers’ networks. Not all Boost Mobile devices have an MSL code or a locking function that can be unlocked by Boost Mobile.&nbsp; And, on certain devices, not all functionality may be unlocked (<em>e.g.,</em> for some smartphone devices, only the CDMA/voice functionality of the device may be able to be unlocked but not the GSM/UMTS/LTE portion of the device).&nbsp; Therefore, “unlocking” simply means using the MSL Code and bypassing the lock.&nbsp; <u>Importantly, however, an unlocked device will not necessarily work or be interoperable with another carrier’s network.</u>&nbsp; <u>Additionally, Boost Mobile devices which the owner has attempted to reprogram or activate on another carrier’s network or otherwise altered from its initial programming or settings may not be able to be reactivated on the Sprint network.</u></li>-->
										<p>
											Domestic SIM Unlocking ("DSU"): A device may be referred to as "locked" if that device was manufactured with the programming restrictions that pevent another carrier's SIM card from being inserted into the SIM slot for use on a different network.  Generally, most smartphones launched after February 2015 are DSU-capable - meaning the SIM slot can be unlocked for potential usage on other carriers in the United States.  Even if unlocked.  Sprint DSU-capable devices may not work on another carrier's network.  Whether an unlocked Sprint device can be used on another carrier's network is subject to that carrier's policies and network compatibilities.
											
										
										MSL Unlocking: A device is "locked" if it is manufactured with a type of disabling software and a locking code (referred to as "Master Susidy Lock" or "MSL").  Generally, MSL locks were utilized on devices launched before February 2015.  Sprint can provide the MSL code to eligible customers, however this does not mean that the device will be able to be successfully used on any other carrier domestically.  Whether another carrier will accept and activate a device on its network is subject to that carrier's policies and compatibilities.

									<h2> <a id="can-i-share-a-uicc-card-between-two-phones">Can I share a UICC card between two phones?</a> </h2>
									<p>UICCs may not be shared between two devices. Each UICC is assigned to a transceiver (device) and paired together. Users may not simply pop a UICC out of one device and use it immediately in another device. This is known as 'pop and swap'. Boost Mobile specifically activates and checks for the paired equipment when connecting to the Sprint network.</p>

									<p>No.&nbsp; Boost Mobile elects to post its unlocking policies and procedures online.&nbsp; However, if you believe you meet the above requirements and would like to request that your DSU-capable device be unlocked and/or request the associated MSL Code, contact Boost Mobile Customer Care at <span class="skype_c2c_print_container notranslate">1-888-BOOST-4U</span><span id="skype_c2c_container" class="skype_c2c_container notranslate" dir="ltr" tabindex="-1" onmouseover="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.showMenu(this, event)" onmouseout="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.hideMenu(this, event)" onclick="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.makeCall(this, event)" data-numbertocall="+18882667848" data-numbertype="tollfree" data-isfreecall="true" data-isrtl="false" data-ismobile="false"><span class="skype_c2c_highlighting_inactive_common" dir="ltr" skypeaction="skype_dropdown"><span class="skype_c2c_textarea_span" id="free_num_ui"><img class="skype_c2c_logo_img" src="resource://skype_ff_extension-at-jetpack/skype_ff_extension/data/call_skype_logo.png" height="0" width="0"><span class="skype_c2c_text_span">1-888-BOOST-4U</span><span class="skype_c2c_free_text_span">&nbsp;FREE</span></span>

									<p>No. Sprint can providethe MSL code to eligible customers to provide to their intended carrier.   Whether another carrier is able to or will reprogram a device is subject to that carrier's policies and practices.
									
									<!--The MSL code may be used to override operational parameters restricting the device to operating with Boost Mobile services; however, the MSL code alone will not enable certain devices to operate on a different carrier's network.

										</span>.</p>
									<p> It is important to note that not all devices are capable of being unlocked, often because of the manufacturers' device designs. Specifically, devices and device models manufactured prior to February 2015 cannot be unlocked to accept a different domestic carrier's SIM for use on another domestic carrier's network. Boost Mobile has no technological process available to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

									<h2> <a id="i-have-been-told-that-my-device-is-not-dsu-capable-what-can-i-do">I have been told that my device is not DSU-capable. What can I do?</a> </h2>
									<p>Many devices that have been manufactured for Boost Mobile simply are not DSU-capable. This is because, prior to the development of the voluntary commitment contained in CTIA's Consumer Code for Wireless Service ("Unlocking Commitment") carriers were not required to, and many carriers did not, develop their devices to be DSU-capable.&nbsp; We strongly encourages owners of such devices to consider Boost Mobile's Buyback Program, which may enable them to trade in their old devices to receive an account credit.&nbsp; For more information, visit <a href="https://buyback.boostmobile.com/">buyback.boostmobile.com</a>.</p>

									<p> For individual owners who can provide the Boost Mobile telephone number or account number last associated with the device, Boost Mobile may be able to unlock the device and/or provide the applicable MSL Code, provided the device is eligible under the applicable policy.&nbsp; If a device is not eligible for any reason, a non-Boost Mobile customer requestor may be required to work with the original purchaser and/or the person from whom the requestor purchased the device to ensure any financial or device eligibility criteria are met.&nbsp; <!--Boost Mobile cannot share any information about any account, including with a non-Boost Mobile customer who has legally purchased a Boost Mobile device, without proper authentication from the account holder or an authorized contact.&nbsp;--> Customers are strongly encouraged to contact Boost Mobile about a device’s unlock eligibility before purchasing through a non-Boost Mobile channel as Boost Mobile cannot share any information regarding an unauthenticated account. </p>
