					<p class="legal">Nationwide Sprint Network. This tool provides high-level estimates of our wireless coverage. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies based on a number of factors. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using your device outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control (network problems, software, signal strength, your wireless device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, etc.), will result in dropped and blocked connections, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of services. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 depend on your device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. E911 services also depend local emergency service provider systems/support. Estimated future coverage subject to change.</p>

For example, if you paid your first month of service on February 15, then your monthly payment date is the 15th every month (March 15, April 15, etc.) and remains the same as long as you successfully make your monthly payment, on-time, every month. With Auto Re-Boost, you will not need to worry about it as long as your form of payment remains actively registered.</p> <p>If your monthly payment date is the 28th, 29th, 30th or 31st of a month then it will always be the same day or the last day of the month.</p> </div> <div class="faq-answer"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="can-i-change-my-monthly-payment-date">Can I change my monthly payment date?</a> </h2> <p>No, your monthly payment date remains the same every month as long as you successfully make your monthly payment on-time.</p> </div> <div class="faq-answer"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="what-happens-if-i-miss-my-monthly-payment">What happens if I miss my monthly payment?</a> </h2> <p>If you are enrolled with Auto Re-Boost with an active form of payment, your service will not be interrupted.</p> <p>If you un-enroll or remove Auto Re-Boost from your account and are on the $35 Data Boost Up 2.5GB plan, the plan cost will increase to $45 and be due by your next MRC date for continued service. You can restore the $35 price by re-enrolling in Auto Re-Boost. You will need to add $45 to your account to restore your service and re-enroll with Auto Re-Boost in order to get back on the $35 Data Boost Up plan.</p> <p>Once service is restored, your monthly payment date will change to one day prior to the date that service was restored (e.g., if your service is restored on February 15th, your monthly payment date will be reset to March 14th). Restoring service at the end of or on the first of the month (i.e., 30th, 31st or 1st) will result in varied payment dates contingent on the last calendar day of the month.</p> <p>You have 60 days to resume service by paying your monthly payment in full or your account will be cancelled and you will lose all funds in your account balance and your phone number.</p> </div> <div class="faq-answer"> <a class="top" href="#top">(top)</a> <h2> <a id="what-happens-if-my-account-balance-goes-to-360-before-my-next-payment-is-due">What happens if my account balance goes to $0 before my next payment is due?</a> </h2> <p> If your account balance reaches zero, but you've already enrolled in Auto Re-Boost, you will be able to use all the unlimited services included in your plan for the remainder of your monthly plan cycle and your registered form of payment will be charged for the following monthly recurring charges.</p> </div>
