      <h3>Tips on international calling with Sprint Prepaid</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make international calls the same way you would from any other phone. Dial 011 + the country code + the city code + the phone number. For countries like Canada, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and other countries marked with a “*” in the table, you don’t have to dial 011 before the number
        </li>
        <li>
          International calls are charged at the international per-minute rate for the country you’re calling when you’re using your monthly plan talk minutes. Standard airtime minute rates may apply for minutes over any monthly talk minute allotment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calls to Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands are included in Sprint Prepaid’s domestic monthly talk plans, so – there is no international charge.
        </li>
        <li>
          International Text: $0.15 per international SMS message sent and received.
        </li>
