            <p><span>Terms of Service.</span> Your service agreement with Virgin Mobile includes, but is not limited to, the terms of your service plan (including those outlined below and set forth in plan disclosure terms,  and device materials) and the most recent Virgin Mobile General Terms and Conditions of Service ( collectively, the "Agreement"). Carefully read all the parts of your Agreement with Virgin Mobile, including the MANDATORY ARBITRATION Provision and CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION set forth in the Agreement. </p>

            <p><span>Rates effective as of 10/4/14.</span> Price, offers and programs are subject to change without notice, may not be available with all devices or in all markets/retail locations, or combinable with other promotions/options. Virgin Mobile plans do not require an annual contract. Certain phones require activation on certain plans and availability may be subject to device availability and/or compatibility. State, local sales taxes and fees may apply when adding funds to accounts. Services are for domestic use only within the U.S. unless stated otherwise and include Caller ID, Voicemail, Call Waiting, Three-way Calling and Call Forwarding while on the Nationwide Sprint Network (usage of minutes will apply).</p>

            <p><span>Activation of Services/Accounts:</span> Activation of service and account will occur when sufficient funds are added to accounts. Service charges are not refunded or prorated if service is terminated or, modified before your next payment due date. Unused services, including, but not limited to, plan minutes, messages or data allotments, expire at the end of each plan cycle or when switching between service plans and do not carry forward. Partial minutes of use are rounded up to the next whole minute. Switching between Virgin Mobile service offerings may result in a new prepaid account. Coverage is not available everywhere and varies by service. Visit virginmobileusa.com/check-cell-phone-coverage for details and the latest coverage info. Our services will only work with our devices - not all services are available with all devices or on all networks. Not all services available on 4G and coverage may default to 3G/1xRTT where 4G is unavailable.</p>

            <p><span>Nature of our Service.</span> Our rate plans, customer devices, services and features are not for resale and are intended for reasonable and non-continuous use by a person using a device on the Sprint network. The primary use of your device must be for domestic purposes within the Sprint-owned network and for other purposes outlined in our offers. Domestic means use in the 48 contiguous states, Hawaii, DC, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Virgin Mobile may limit or terminate service if you move outside of the Sprint owned-network. </p>

            <p><span>Unlimited Use Plans.</span> Unlimited does not mean unreasonable. If you subscribe to rate plans, services or features that are described as "unlimited", you should be aware that such unlimited plans are subject to the Prohibited Network Uses detailed below. </p>

            <p><span>Prohibited Network Uses.</span>  To ensure that the activities of some users do not impair the ability of our customers to have access to reliable services at reasonable costs, you may not use our services in a manner that is unlawful, infringes on intellectual property rights, adversely harms, unduly interferes or affect the ability of other people or systems to use either our wireless services or other parties' internet-based resources, and for any other reason that, in our sole discretion, harms our network.  Virgin Mobile reserves the right, without notice or limitation, to terminate individual calls, offer a different service plan with no unlimited usage components, limit data throughput speeds or quantities, deny, terminate, end, modify, disconnect or suspend service, and/or decline to renew service, if in its sole discretion, Virgin Mobile determines such action is necessary to protect its wireless networks and/or its customers' service experience from harm and/or degradation. <span>Examples of Prohibited Voice Services uses:</span> Virgin Mobile voice services are provided solely for live dialogue between, and initiated by, two individuals for personal use &amp; as otherwise described in this policy. Virgin Mobile voice services may not be used for, nor are they intended for, any other commercial purposes, including, but not limited to, conference calling, voice monitoring services, data transmissions, transmission of broadcasts, transmission of recorded material, interconnection to other networks, telemarketing, autodialed calls, other commercial voice uses, and other connections that do not consist of uninterrupted live dialogue between two individuals. <span>Examples of Prohibited Data Uses:</span> Virgin Mobile data services are provided solely for purposes of web browsing, picture/audio/video messaging, and similar data activities. Virgin Mobile data services may not be used: (1) with server devices or host computer applications or other systems that drive continuous heavy traffic or data sessions, including, but not limited to, disproportionate web camera posts or broadcasts, automatic data feeds, automated machine-to-machine connections, and peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing applications broadcast to multiple servers or recipients such that they could enable "bots" or similar routines; (2) as a substitute or backup for private lines or frame relay connections sending unsolicited, unauthorized, or unwanted spam SMS, (3) sending unsolicited, unauthorized, or unwanted spam picture/audio/video messages ("MMS"); (4) sending or receiving unusually high numbers of MMS messages. <span>Examples of Prohibited Messaging Uses:</span> Virgin Mobile text messaging services are provided solely for personal use and communication between and/or initiated by two individuals. You may not use messaging services for commercial purposes, including, but not limited to, (1) sending unsolicited, unauthorized, or unwanted spam SMS, (2) sending or receiving unusually high numbers of messages.</p>

            <p><span>Plan Throughput Limitations, Performance, and Network Management:</span> With all plans, streaming video data may be limited to 600Kbps at all times which may impact quality and performance. With certain plans, throughput data speeds will be slowed when data usage exceeds the selected plan's applicable data threshold(s). During this time, data access will continue but maximum speeds (including video) will be limited to 2G speeds of 128Kbps or below for the remainder of plan cycle, resulting in slower page loads, downloads, and degraded streaming media. Data speeds will be restored at the beginning of a new plan cycle, or after a plan cycle restart. Data use can be monitored online in ‘MyAccount'. Other plans may receive prioritized bandwidth availability. For more information on Sprint's network management tools, policies and other related information, please visit virginmobileusa.com/networkmanagement. </p>

            <p><i>The following terms and conditions are specific to Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up payments and are supplemental to (and do not supersede) the Virgin Mobile® Service Agreement, which includes the Important Service/Product Specific and General Terms and Conditions of Service, that you received and accepted when you first became a Virgin Mobile® customer. Your continued access to or use of the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service after the receipt and review hereof constitutes your consent to the terms contained herein and your continued consent to the terms contained in the Service Agreement. You also continue to be bound by the terms of the Virgin Mobile® Privacy Policy which details the conditions and circumstances under which, in the ordinary course of business, Virgin Mobile® may provide information concerning you or your account to third parties.  All of these terms and policy are available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.virginmobileusa.com/legal/important-service-product-information.html">http://www.virginmobileusa.com/legal/important-service-product-information.html.</a></i></p>

            <p>The following "Recurring Terms &amp; Conditions" apply to all Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up Payment Options. Three "Payment-Specific Terms &amp; Conditions" follow these General Terms &amp; Conditions and govern the three individual Payment Options offered under Auto Payment or Auto Top-Up: (i) Low Balance, and (ii) Monthly, and (iii) 90-Day. Only one of the two Payment-Specific Terms &amp; Conditions will apply to you, depending on which Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up Payment Option you selected when you enrolled in Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up.</p>

            <h5 style="text-align:center;text-decoration:underline" class="tos_header">Recurring Terms and Conditions</h5>

            <p style="text-align:center">(Applicable to <span class="tos_header">ALL</span> Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up Subscribers)</p>

            <h5>General Payment Information</h5>
            <p>A valid major credit card, debit card or PayPal account (a "Registered Payment Method") must be registered and on file with Virgin Mobile® at all times to take advantage of automatic payments. Only one (1) card or PayPal account may be registered for any Virgin Mobile™ telephone number. If a payment is returned for any reason, you will not be able to use a credit/debit card or PayPal until your account is in good standing. If you need to change or update your payment information, please either call Virgin Mobile™ Customer Care (dial *729 from your Virgin Mobile™ handset) or access "My Account".</p>

            <h5>Billing; Notifications</h5>
            <p><span>You will be automatically billed for the recurring payments corresponding to your Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up Payment Option as set forth under the applicable Payment-Specific Terms &amp; Conditions below until you affirmatively unenroll from the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service in accordance with the section below entitled "Unenroll". These recurring charges and all other charges to your account are nonrefundable.</span> Virgin Mobile® will send a text message notification to your Virgin Mobile™ handset or email if you have a broadband device indicating whether the attempt to charge your Registered Payment Method was successful and, if so, how much was charged and when the charge was made. Virgin Mobile® will not charge you for these text or email messages. These notifications will be your only notices of payment. By law, you also have the right to receive notice 10 days prior to any transfer that varies in amount from the previous transfer or from the amount you selected at the time of the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up enrollment; <span class="tos_header">however</span>, by enrolling in the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service, you elect to receive such notice only when a transfer differs from the previous transfer by more than $10.00.</p>

            <h5>Adding Funds Manually</h5>
            <p>You can manually add funds using your Registered Payment Method on file either by accessing the "Pay Now" section under "My Account" or by calling Virgin Mobile™ Customer Care (dial *729 from your Virgin Mobile™ handset). You can also add funds at any authorized Virgin Mobile® replenishment location.</p>

            <h5>Unenroll</h5>
            <p>To unenroll from the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service, you must affirmatively unenroll either by calling Virgin Mobile™ Customer Care (dial *729 from your Virgin Mobile™ handset) or by checking the appropriate "I don't want to use it to pay for my Monthly Plan or any other monthly charges" box for Monthly Auto Pay or "I don't want Auto Top-Up" for Low Balance or 90-Day Auto Top-Up under My Account". Cancellation will become effective immediately.<span> You understand that by unenrolling you will be terminating not just your selected Payment Option, you will be terminating your Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service entirely. Switching to a new Payment Option will require you to re-enroll in the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service.</span> However, unenrolling will not delete the Registered Payment Method you have on file.</p>

            <h5>Questions and Errors</h5>
            <p>If you have questions about any electronic transfer, or if you believe there is an error regarding a transfer set forth in the text message and/or email referred to in the section above entitled "Billing; Notifications", please call us as soon as possible (dial *729 from your Virgin Mobile™ handset) or write us at Virgin Mobile, 10 Independence Blvd., Warren, NJ 07059.

You are not liable for unauthorized electronic transfers, or for Virgin Mobile's® failure to properly make or stop certain transfers as required; however, we must hear from you regarding the suspected problem or error no later than 60 days after we send the applicable text message and/or email on which the problem or error appears. Your complaint or question should include the following information:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Your name and phone number;</li>

            </ol>

            <p>If you tell us of your complaint or question over the phone, we may require that you follow up by sending us the relevant information in writing within 10 business days.</p>

            <p>Within 10 business days after your call or our receipt of your written statement containing the information described above, we will attempt to determine whether an error has occurred and if it has, we will promptly correct the error. However, we may require up to 45 days to investigate the matter (90 days for new accounts or point-of-sale or foreign transactions), and if we do, we will temporarily credit the disputed amount to your account within 10 business days (20 business days for new accounts) so that you will have the use of the money or airtime during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account.</p>

            <p>We will inform you of the results of our investigation within three business days after completion. If we determine that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. If we determine there was an error, we will promptly credit the appropriate airtime or dollar amount to your account. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>

            <p>The account holder can typically change Services upon request. In some instances, changes may be conditioned on payment of certain charges. The effective date of any changes will depend on our Policies, the old Services, and the requested Services. We will not credit or refund any subscription or other charges as a result of a change in Services. We may—but are not obligated to—provide you the opportunity to authorize someone else to make changes to your Services. You are responsible for any changes to your Services made by a person you authorize, and those changes will be treated as modifications to this Agreement.</p>

            <h5>Restrictions On Using Services</h5>
            <p>You can't use our Services: (a) in a way that could cause damage or adversely affect any of our other customers or our reputation, networks, property, or Services; or (b) in any way prohibited by the terms of our Services, the Agreement, or our Policies. You cannot in any manner resell the Services to another party. For additional restrictions on the use of our Services, see our Acceptable Use Policy and Visitors Agreement, which are available on our website, and the detailed plan or other information on Services that we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction.</p>

            <h5>Your Device, Number, &amp; Email Address; Caller ID</h5>
            <p>We don't manufacture any Device that we might sell to you or that is associated with our Services, and we aren't responsible for any defects, acts, or omissions of the manufacturer. <span>The only warranties on your Device are the limited warranties given to you by the manufacturer directly or that we pass through. Device performance may vary based on device specifications (for example, a device's software, memory, and storage), and device performance may impact access to all of our Services.</span> This Device is sold exclusively for use with our Service and in other coverage areas that we may make available to you. As programmed, it will not accept wireless service from another carrier. Except for any legal right you may have to port/transfer your phone number to another carrier, you have no-and cannot gain any (for example, through publication, use, etc.)-proprietary, ownership, or other rights to any phone number, identification number, email address, or other identifier that we assign to you, your Device, or your account. We'll notify you if we decide to change or reassign them.</p>

            <h5>Porting/Transferring Phone Numbers</h5>
            <p>We don't guarantee that number transfers to or from us will be successful. If you authorize another carrier to transfer a number away from us, then that is considered a request by you to us to terminate all of the Services associated with that number.</p>

            <h5>Coverage; Where Your Device Will Work; Service Speeds</h5>
            <p>Our coverage maps are available at our authorized retail locations or virginmobileusa.com. The specific network coverage you get will depend on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and Services you've chosen. <span>Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Coverage and Service speeds are not guaranteed. Coverage is subject to change without notice. Service speeds may depend on the Service purchased. Actual speeds will vary. Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength, and Service speed is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that—along with other factors both within and beyond our control (for example, network problems, network or Internet congestion, software, signal strength, your Device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you access, actions of third parties, etc.)—may result in dropped and blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 and GPS navigation, depend on your Device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage.</span> While your Device is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your Device in any manner until the software update is complete.</p>

            <h5>Roaming</h5>
            <p>The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that we may make available to you based on our agreements with other carriers. These agreements may change from time to time, and roaming coverage is subject to change without notice. Your ability to receive roaming coverage depends on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and the availability of roaming coverage. We make no guarantee that roaming coverage will be available. Roaming coverage may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas. Your Device will generally indicate when you're roaming. Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of minutes used while roaming may apply. Certain Services may not be available or work the same when roaming (for example, data Services, voicemail, call waiting, etc.). For information on whether roaming applies, see your service plan details.</p>

            <h5>About Data Services &amp; Content</h5>
            <p>Our data Services and your Device may allow you to access the Internet, text, pictures, video, games, graphics, music, email, applications, sound, and other materials ("Data Content") or send Data Content elsewhere. Some Data Content is available from us or our vendors, while other Data Content can be accessed from others (for example, third party websites, games, ringers, applications, etc.). We make absolutely no guarantees about the Data Content that you access on your Device. <b>Data Content may be: (1) unsuitable for children/minors; (2) unreliable or inaccurate; or (3) offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You're solely responsible for evaluating the Data Content accessed by you or anyone through your Services. We strongly recommend that you monitor data usage by children/minors.</b> Data Content from third parties may also harm your Device or its software. We are not responsible for any Data Content. We are not responsible for any damage caused by any Data Content that you access through your Services, that you load on your Device, or that you request that our representatives access or load on your Device. To protect our networks and Services or for other reasons, we may place restrictions on accessing certain Data Content (such as certain websites, applications, etc.); impose separate charges; limit throughput or the amount of data that you can transfer; or otherwise limit or terminate Services. If we provide you storage for Data Content that you have purchased, then we may delete the Data Content without notice or place restrictions/limits on the use of storage areas. Data Content stored on a Device, transmitted over our networks, or stored by Virgin Mobile may be deleted, modified, or damaged. You may not be able to make or receive voice calls while using data Services. Data Content provided by our vendors or third parties is subject to cancellation or termination at any time without notice to you, and you may not receive a refund for any unused portion of the Data Content.</p>

            <h5>Specific Terms &amp; Restrictions On Using Data Services</h5>
            <p>In addition to the rules for using all of our other Services, unless we identify the Service or Device that you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, wireless routers, Data Link, etc.), you can't use our data Services: (1) with server devices or host computer applications, or other systems that drive continuous, heavy traffic or data sessions; (2) as a substitute or backup for private lines or frame relay connections; or (3) for any other unintended use as we determine in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to limit, suspend, or constrain any heavy, continuous data usage that adversely impacts our networks' performance or hinders access to our networks. If your Services include Web or data access, you also can't use your Device as a modem for computers or other equipment, unless we identify the Service or Device you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, with "phone as modem" plans, mobile broadband card plans, wireless router plans, etc.).</p>

            <h5>Software License</h5>
            <p>If Virgin Mobile provides you software as part of the Service and there are not software license terms provided with the software (by Virgin Mobile or by a third party), then Virgin Mobile grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the software to access the Services for your own individual use. You will not sell, resell, transfer, copy, translate, publish, create derivative works of, make any commercial use of, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software. Virgin Mobile may revoke this license at any time.</p>

          <h5>Fees, Activation &amp; Miscellaneous Charges</h5>
          <p>Based on our Policies, we may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain Services. Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, handset upgrades, etc.). You will be provided notice of these types of fees before we complete the requested transaction. </p>

          <h5>Usage Charges</h5>
          <p>The types of charges that you incur will vary depending on the Service used and your service plan. <span>You are responsible for the Services on your account and associated charges, including charges made by a person you permit to have direct or indirect access to your device even if you did not authorize its use.</span> Charges may include, but are not limited to, prepayment for service charges; charges for additional services; and taxes, surcharges, and fees associated with your Services. For the actual usage charges applicable to your Service, see the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction or on our website. Depending on your Services, charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, data calls, texts, and Web access. If you (the account holder) allow end users to access or use your Device, you authorize end users to access, download, and use Services. You will generally be charged for use of Services before or at the time of use in accordance with your service plan. In certain instances, we may charge at some point after you use the Service. Rates that vary based on the time of access will be determined based on the location of the network equipment providing service and not the location of your Device or your Device's area code (if applicable). Charges are generally deducted from your account balance (for example, pay-per-use charges, subscription charges, etc.), though in some instances you may be able to pay for certain Services through a credit card, debit card, or other payment method. If you have incurred charges or fees that were not charged prior to your account balance reaching a zero balance, we may deduct these outstanding, unpaid charges and fees from any subsequent amounts you add to your account balance.</p>

            <h5>Types of Charges</h5>
            <p>We typically assess the following types of charges: (1) "pay-per-use charges," which are charges assessed each time a Service is used; (2) "subscription charges," which are charges that allow you access to a Service or provide you a certain amount of use of a Service for a defined period of time. Subscription charges for Services end at 11:59 p.m., in the time zone in which your phone number is based, on the last day of your subscription period. Also, depending on your Service, certain types of subscription charges may be assessed automatically upon activation and automatically assessed for subsequent subscription periods; and (3) "download charges," which are charges assessed when you download or access content, which we collect on behalf of ourselves or third-party content providers. </p>

            <h5>How We Calculate Your Charges</h5>
            <p><span>Regular Voice Calls: </span>We round up partial minutes of use to the next full minute. Time starts when you press "Talk" or your Device connects to the network and stops when you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. You're charged for all calls that connect, even to answering machines, voicemail, or voice transcription services. You won't be charged for unanswered calls or if you get a busy signal. For incoming calls answered, you're charged from the time shortly before the Device starts ringing until you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. You're charged for the entire call based on the rate that applies to the time period in which the call starts. However, the types of charges actually deducted from your account balance will vary depending on your Service. Call time data displayed on your device may be inaccurate and may not be relied upon for determining charges to your account. Call time for a single call may be subject to a maximum duration and may be automatically terminated if the maximum duration is exceeded.
              <br>
              <br>
              <span>Data Usage: </span>Depending on your Service, you may be charged for data usage. Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, data usage is measured in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes—not in minutes/time. 1024 bytes equals 1 kilobyte ("KB"), 1024 KB equals 1 megabyte, and 1024 megabytes equals 1 gigabyte. Bytes are rounded up to KB, so you will be charged at least 1 KB for each data usage session ("data session"). Rounding occurs at the end of each data session and sometimes during a data session. Depending on your data Services, usage may be charged against an allowance or on a fixed price per KB, and you may be subject to limitations on the amount of data usage. If you are charged on a fixed price per KB, any fractional cents will be rounded up to the next cent. You are charged for all data directed to your Device's Internet address, including data sessions you did not initiate and for incomplete transfers. As long as your Device is connected to our data networks, you may incur data charges. Examples of data for which you will be charged includes the size of a requested file or Data Content (game, ringer, etc.); Web page graphics (logos, pictures, banners, advertisement, etc.); additional data used in accessing, transporting, and routing the file on our network; data from partial or interrupted downloads; re-sent data; and data associated with unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications. These data charges are in addition to any charges for the Data Content itself (game, ringer, etc.). Data used and charged to you will vary widely, even between identical actions or data sessions. Estimates of data usage—for example, the size of downloadable files—are not reliable predictors of actual usage. </p>

            <h5>Taxes &amp; Government Fees</h5>
            <p>You agree to pay all federal, state, and local taxes, fees, and other assessments that we're required by law to collect and remit to the government on the Services that we provide to you. These charges may change from time to time without advance notice. If you're claiming any tax exemption, you must provide us with a valid exemption certificate. Tax exemptions generally won't be applied retroactively.</p>

            <h5>Surcharges</h5>
            <p>You agree to pay all surcharges ("Surcharges"), which may include, but are not limited to: Federal Universal Service; various regulatory charges; Virgin Mobile administrative charges; gross receipts charges and certain other taxes imposed upon Virgin Mobile; or charges for the costs that we incur and pass along to you. <b>Surcharges are not taxes, and we are not required to assess them by law. They are charges we choose to collect from you, are part of our rates, and are kept by us in whole or in part. The number and type of Surcharges will be provided and may vary depending upon the location of the transaction or the primary account address of the payment method or Device and can change over time. We determine the rate for these charges, and these amounts are subject to change as are the components used to calculate these amounts.</b> We will provide you notice of any changes to Surcharges in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section). However, since some Surcharges are based on amounts set by the government or based on government formulas, it will not always be possible to provide advance notice of new Surcharges or changes in the amount of existing Surcharges. Information on Surcharges is provided during the sales transaction and is available on our website.</p>

            <h5>Disputing Charges</h5>
            <p>Any dispute to a charge that we assess you must be made in writing within 60 days of the date we deduct the charge from your account balance. You accept all charges not properly disputed within the above time period. </p>

            <h5>About Account Balances</h5>
            <p>To keep your account active and avoid service interruption, you must either maintain a positive account balance at all times or pay any applicable subscription charges, depending on your service plan. Account balances are not transferable, redeemable for cash, or refundable. Charges are deducted from either your account balance or you may be able to pay for certain services with a credit card, debit card, or PayPal account (a "registered payment method").There may be limits on your account administration, for example account balance, number change, and device changes. See the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction (also available at virginmobileusa.com) for the account status rules that apply to your Service.
              <br>
              <br>
              <span>Switching between Service Plans:</span> Unless otherwise provided in the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction, you may switch current service plans, including between Virgin Mobile and payLo. When you switch service plans, you will not receive a refund of any portion of any previously paid service charges and you will lose all of your remaining unused minutes, messages, and data allotment. Virgin Mobile and payLo accounts are maintained separately. If you switch between a Virgin Mobile service plan and a payLo service plan, your Virgin Mobile or payLo account (as applicable) may be closed and you may be given a new Virgin Mobile or payLo account (as applicable). Some service plans are available only on certain phones. Check virginmobileusa.com for details and options. Repeated switching is not permitted and may result in termination of service.
              <br>
              <br>
              <span>Refunds:</span> We are not responsible for, nor do we refund, lost, stolen, misused, or damaged Top-Up cards. We do not accept returns of or provide refunds for Top-Up cards. Please ask your retailer any questions regarding its return policy. Top-Up cards must be applied to your account within the time specified on the card. All Top-Up sales are final and non-refundable regardless of who uses or possesses your mobile phone or device after you purchase services, and regardless of whether the mobile phone or device is used with your consent or knowledge.</p>

            <h5>Establishing or Replenishing Account Balances</h5>
            <p>Information on how you can establish and maintain an account balance will be provided at activation and is also available at virginmobileusa.com or through Virgin Mobile Customer Care. The replenishment methods available to you will depend on the terms of your Services. A fee may apply to certain replenishment methods. Some service plans may provide for automatic account balance replenishment through, for example, automatic billing to a credit card or debit card or automatic debit from an eligible account with a financial institution. Payment through these methods may be subject to limitations, including, but not limited to, the number of times an account may be debited or charged in a particular time period; the amount that may be debited or charged from an account; or other limitations imposed by us or the financial institution that holds the account.</p>

            <h5>Protecting Our Networks &amp; Services</h5>
            <p>We can take any action to: (1) protect our networks, our rights and interests, or the rights of others; or (2) optimize or improve the overall use of our networks and Services. Some of these actions may interrupt or prevent legitimate communications and usage—for example, message filtering/blocking software to prevent spam or viruses; limiting throughput; limiting access to certain websites, applications or other Data Content; prohibitions on unintended uses (for example, use as a dedicated line or use as a monitoring service); etc. For additional information on what we do to protect our customers, networks, Services and equipment, see our Acceptable Use Policy and Visitors Agreement at our website. </p>

            <h5>Your Privacy</h5>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy is available at virginmobileusa.com/legal/privacy-policy. This policy may change from time to time, so review it with regularity and care.
              <br>
              <br>
              <span>Call Monitoring:</span> To ensure the quality of our Services and for other lawful purposes, we may monitor or record calls between us (for example, your conversations with our customer service or sales departments).
              <br>
              <br>
              <span>Authentication and Contact:</span> You (the account holder) may password protect your account information by establishing a personal identification number ("PIN"). You may also set a backup security question and answer in the event you forget your PIN. You agree to protect your PIN, passwords, and other account access credentials like your backup security question from loss or disclosure. You further agree that Virgin Mobile may, in our sole discretion, treat any person who presents your credentials that we deem sufficient for account access as you or an authorized user on the account for disclosure of information or changes in Service. You agree that we may contact you for Service-related reasons through the contact information that you provide, through the Services or Devices to which you subscribe, or through other available means, including text message, email, fax, recorded message, mobile, residential or business phone, or mail.
              <br>
              <br>
              <span>CPNI:</span> As we provide telecommunications products and Services to you (the account holder), we develop information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location, and destination of telecommunications products and Services you use, as well as some other information found on your bill ("CPNI"). Under federal law, you have the right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI. For example, we implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI, including authentication procedures when you contact us. For some accounts with a dedicated Virgin Mobile representative, we may rely on contacting your pre-established point of contact as the standard authentication measure.
              <br>
              <br>
              <span>Third-Party Applications:</span> If you use a third-party application, the application may access, collect, use, or disclose your personal information or require Virgin Mobile to disclose your information—including location information (when applicable)—to the application provider or some other third party. If you access, use, or authorize third-party applications through the Services, you agree and authorize Virgin Mobile to provide information related to your use of the Services or the application(s). You understand that your use of third-party applications is subject to the third party's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. Be sure that you have reviewed and are comfortable with the third party's policies before using its application on your device.
              <br>
              <br>
              <span>Information on Devices:</span> Your Device may contain sensitive or personal information (for example, pictures, videos, passwords, or stored credit card numbers). Virgin Mobile is not responsible for any information on your Device, including sensitive or personal information. If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your Device is out of your possession or control, for example, when you relinquish, exchange, return, or recycle your Device. By submitting your Device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on your Device. If you exchange, return, or recycle your Device through us, we typically attempt to erase data on your Device but you must remove all data from your Device before you provide it to us.

              <br>
              <br>
            </p>

            <h5>Location-Enabled Services</h5>
            <p>Our networks generally know the location of your Device when it is outdoors and/or turned on. By using various technologies to locate your Device, we can provide enhanced emergency 911 services and optional location-enabled services provided by us or a third party. Network coverage or environmental factors (such as structures, buildings, weather, geography, landscape, and topography) can significantly impact the ability to access your Device's location information and use of location-enabled services.
              <br>
              <br>
              You agree that any authorized user may access, use, or authorize Virgin Mobile or third-party location-enabled applications through the Services. You understand that your use of such location-enabled applications is subject to the application's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. If you activate location-enabled services for devices used by other authorized users, you agree to inform the authorized user(s) of the terms of use for location-enabled applications and that the Device may be located.
            </p>

            <h5>911 Or Other Emergency Calls</h5>
            <p><span>Public safety officials advise that when making 911 or other emergency calls, you should always be prepared to provide your location information.</span> Unlike traditional wireline phones, depending on a number of factors (for example, whether your Device is GPS-enabled, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know your phone number, your location, or the location of your Device. In certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers. Enhanced 911 service ("E911")—where enabled by local emergency authorities—uses GPS technology to provide location information. Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information. If your Device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located. Some Devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911—you should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing interactive voice response systems to screen calls.</p>

            <h5>If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen</h5>
            <p>Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen because you may be responsible for usage charges before you notify us of the alleged loss or theft. You agree to cooperate if we choose to investigate the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.). We may not credit or refund any account balance if you choose to terminate Services as a result of loss or theft of your Device. If you do not either activate a new device or notify us that you have found your device within 60 days of the suspension of your account, your account will be deactivated, we may assess a charge equal to the balance in your account (which is not refundable), and, if applicable, you will lose your phone number. </p>

            <h5>Disclaimer of Warranties</h5>
            <p>UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN WRITING OTHERWISE, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE CONCERNING YOUR SERVICES (INCLUDING YOUR DEVICE AND ANY SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS ON YOUR DEVICE). WE DON'T PROMISE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICES AND DON'T AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO MAKE WARRANTIES ON OUR BEHALF. SPRINT PROVIDES ALL SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITH ALL FAULTS, ERRORS, AND DEFECTS.</p>

            <h5 >You Agree That We Are Not Responsible For Certain Problems</h5>
            <p>You agree that neither we nor our parent, subsidiary, or affiliate companies, nor our vendors, suppliers, or licensors are responsible for any damages resulting from: (a) anything done or not done by someone else; (b) providing or failing to provide Services, including, but not limited to, deficiencies or problems with a Device or network coverage (for example, dropped, blocked, interrupted Services, etc.); (c) traffic or other accidents, or any health-related claims relating to our Services; (d) Data Content or information accessed while using our Services; (e) an interruption or failure in accessing or attempting to access emergency services from a Device, including through 911, Enhanced 911 or otherwise; (f) interrupted, failed, or inaccurate location information services; (g) information or communication that is blocked by a spam filter; (h) damage to your Device or any computer or equipment connected to your Device, or damage to or loss of any information stored on your Device, computer, equipment, or Virgin Mobile storage space from your use of the Services or from viruses, worms, or downloads of malicious content, materials, data, text, images, video, or audio; or (i) things beyond our control, including acts of God (for example, weather-related phenomena, fire, earthquake, hurricane, etc.), riot, strike, war, terrorism, or government orders or acts. You should implement appropriate safeguards to secure your Device, computer, or equipment and to backup your information stored on each.</p>

            <h5>You Agree That Our Liability Is Limited - No Consequential Damages</h5>
            <p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, OUR LIABILITY FOR MONETARY DAMAGES FOR ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THE PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE SERVICE CHARGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AFFECTED PERIOD. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH A DEVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. </p>

            <div class="ex">

              <span>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</span>
              <p>
                  <span>We Each Agree To First Contact Each Other With Any Disputes</span>
                  <br>
                  We each agree to first contact each other with any Disputes (defined below) and provide a written description of the problem, relevant documents and supporting information, and the proposed resolution. We agree to contact each other as described in the "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <span>Instead Of Suing In Court, We Each Agree To Arbitrate Disputes</span>
                  <br>
                  We each agree to arbitrate all Disputes between us, on an individual basis, not on a class-wide or consolidated basis. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. In arbitration, there's no judge or jury. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms and limitations in the Agreement and can award damages and relief, including any attorneys' fees authorized by law. The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. We each also agree as follows:
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (1) <span>"Disputes" are any claims or controversies against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way our Services or the Agreement, including, but not limited to, coverage, Devices, billing services and practices, policies, contract practices (including enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, even if it arises after Services have terminated. </span> Disputes include claims that: (a) you bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; (b) you bring against a third party, such as a retailer or equipment manufacturer, that are based on, relate to, or arise out of in any way our Services or the Agreement; or (c) that we bring against you. It also includes but is not limited to claims related in any way to or arising out of in any way any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (2) If either of us wants to initiate a claim to arbitrate a Dispute, we each agree to send written notice to the other providing a description of the dispute, a description of previous efforts to resolve the dispute, relevant documents and supporting information, and the proposed resolution. Notice to you will be sent as described in the "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section and notice to us will be sent to: General Counsel; Arbitration Office; 12502 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mailstop VARESA0202-2C682; Reston, Virginia 20191. We each agree to make attempts to resolve the dispute prior to filing a claim for arbitration. If we each cannot resolve the dispute within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the notice to arbitrate, then we each may submit the dispute to formal arbitration.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (3) The FAA applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision. We each agree that the FAA's provisions—not state law—govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (4) Unless we each agree otherwise, the Arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in the county of the last billing address of the Service.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (5) The arbitration will be governed and conducted by (a) a neutral third-party arbitrator selected by each of us and based upon rules mutually agreed to by each of us or (b) JAMS. The JAMS rules, including rules about the selection of an arbitrator, filing, administration, discovery, and arbitrator fees, will be conducted under JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures. The JAMS rules are available on its website at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a>. To the extent that this "Dispute Resolution and Arbitration" section conflicts with JAMS's minimum standards for procedural fairness, the JAMS's rules or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard will apply. However, nothing in this paragraph will require or allow us or you to arbitrate on a class-wide or consolidated basis.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (6) <span>WE EACH AGREE THAT WE WILL ONLY PURSUE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND WILL NOT PURSUE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS-WIDE OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS. We each agree not to pursue arbitration on a classwide basis. We each agree that any arbitration will be solely between you and Virgin Mobile (not brought on behalf of or together with another individual's claim). If for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate doesn't apply and the dispute must be brought in court.</span>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (7) We each are responsible for our respective costs relating to counsel, experts, and witnesses, as well as any other costs relating to the arbitration. However, we will pay for the arbitration administrative or filing fees, including the arbitrator fees. Otherwise the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses, Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness regarding costs and payment apply.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <span>Exceptions To Our Agreement To Arbitrate Disputes</span>
                  <br>
                  Either of us may bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, this arbitration provision does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency that can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.

          <br>
          <br>
          <h5>No Class Actions</h5>
          <p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
          <h5>No Trial By Jury</h5>
          <p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
          <h5>Indemnification</h5>
          <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Virgin Mobile and our subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, vendors, suppliers, and licensors harmless from any claims arising out of or relating to your actions, including, but not limited to, your use of the Service and any information you submit, post, transmit, or make available via the Service; failing to provide appropriate notices regarding location-enabled services (see "Location-Enabled Services" section); failure to safeguard your passwords, backup question to your shared secret question, or other account information; or violating this Agreement or any policy referenced in this Agreement, any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party.</p>
          <h5>Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement</h5>
          <p>Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, you must deliver written notice to us by mail to Virgin Mobile USA, L.P., 10 Independent Blvd., Warren, NJ 07059 or email to ourteam@virginmobileusa.com. We will provide you notice by correspondence to your last known address in our records, to any fax number or email address you've provided us, by calling you on your Device or any other phone number you've provided us, by voice message on your Device or any other phone number you've provided us, or by text message on your Device. </p>
          <h5>Other Important Terms</h5>
          <p>Subject to federal law or unless the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, this Agreement is governed solely by the laws of the state encompassing the area code assigned to your Device, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of that state. If either of us waives or doesn't enforce a requirement under this Agreement in an instance, we don't waive our right to later enforce that requirement. Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, if any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the rest of this Agreement remains in full force and effect. This Agreement isn't for the benefit of any third party except our corporate parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and predecessors and successors in interest. You can't assign the Agreement or any of your rights or duties under it unless we agree to the assignment. We can assign the Agreement without notice. You cannot in any manner resell Devices or Services to another party. You cannot export any Device. The Agreement and the documents it incorporates make up the entire agreement between us and replaces all prior written or spoken agreements—you can't rely on any contradictory documents or statements by sales or service representatives. The rights, obligations, and commitments in the Agreement that—by their nature—would logically continue beyond the termination of Services (for example, those relating to billing, payment, 911, dispute resolution, no class action, no jury trial) survive termination of Services.</p>

        <p>Please note that these terms may not be the most current version. A current version of the terms is available at boostmobile.com or upon request. For further information on Boost Mobile plans, products, and services go to boostmobile.com or email <a href="mailto:Boostmobilecustomerassistance@boostmobile.com">Boostmobilecustomerassistance@boostmobile.com</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>Basic Definitions</strong><br>
        In this document: (1) "we," "us," "our," and "Boost" mean Sprint Solutions, Inc., as contracting agent on behalf of the applicable Sprint affiliated entities providing the Products and Services; (2) "you," "your," "customer," and "user" mean an account holder or user with us; (3) "Device" means any phone, aircard, mobile broadband device, any other device, accessory, or other product that we provide you, we sell to you, or is active on your account with us; and (4) "Service" means our offers, rate or service plans, options, wireless services, billing services, applications, programs, products, software, or Devices on your account with us. "Service(s)" also includes any other product or service that we offer or provide to you that references these General Terms and Conditions of Service ("Ts&Cs").</p>

        <p><strong>The Service Agreement</strong></br>
        These Ts&Cs are part of your service agreement with us (the "Agreement") and constitute a contract under which we provide you Services under terms and conditions that you accept. <strong>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WITH A CLASS WAIVER, A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER, AND A JURY WAIVER PROVISION.</strong> In addition to these Ts&Cs, there are several parts of the Agreement, which includes but is not limited to the following: (i) the subscriber agreement and transaction materials that you receive and accept; (ii) the plan(s) that you chose as set forth in our written services and transaction materials that we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction, including on-line and telephone transactions (if your service plan is not specifically set forth in any in-store brochure or printed materials, the requirements and terms set forth in the current written Agreement and transaction materials apply); (iii) any confirmation materials that we may provide to you; and (iv) the terms set forth in the coverage map brochures. <strong>It is important that you carefully read all of the terms of the Agreement.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Additional Terms</strong><br> 
        Additional terms will apply when you use certain applications, programs, Devices, and services, and these terms will be provided to you prior to your use of the items. Depending on who provides the items, the terms may come from Boost or a third party. You are subject to any terms provided by the third party, and the terms are directly between you and that third party. Boost is not responsible for these third-party items and associated terms.</p>

        <p><strong>Our Policies</strong><br>
        Services are subject to our business policies, practices, and procedures ("Policies"). You agree to adhere to all of our Policies when you use our Services. Our Policies are subject to change at any time with or without notice.</p>

        <p><strong>When You Accept The Agreement</strong><br>
        You must have the legal capacity to accept the Agreement. You accept the Agreement when you do any of the following: (a) accept the Agreement through any printed, oral, or electronic statement, for example, on the Web by electronically marking that you have reviewed and accepted; (b) attempt to or in any way use the Services; (c) pay for the Services; or (d) open any package or start any program that says you are accepting the Agreement when doing so. <strong>If you don't want to accept the Agreement, don't do any of these things.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Service Activation</strong><br>
        To activate the Service, you must both activate your account and establish an appropriate account balance to pay for pay-per-use charges and applicable subscription charges (defined in the "Types of Charges" section) based on the service plan you select. To establish an account balance, pay a subscription charge, or make any other appropriate payments, follow the instructions provided with the equipment; at boostmobile.com; or through Boost Customer Care.</p>

        <p><strong>Our Right To Change The Agreement & Your Related Rights</strong><br>
        <strong>We may change any part of the Agreement at any time, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, how we calculate charges, discounts, coverage, technologies used to provide services, or your terms of Service. If you lose your eligibility for a particular rate plan or if a particular rate plan is no longer supported or available, we may change your rate plan to one for which you qualify. We will provide you notice of material changesâ€”and we may provide you notice of non-material changesâ€”in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section).</strong> If you continue to access or use our Services or increase your account balance on or after the effective date of a change, you accept the change. Do not access or use our Services after the effective date of a change if you decide to reject the change and terminate Service. You will not be entitled to any credit for the unused portion of your account balance if you decide to terminate Service in response to a change to the Agreement.</p>

        <p><strong>Our Right To Suspend Or Terminate Services</strong><br>
        <strong>We can, without notice, suspend or terminate any Service at any time for any reason.</strong>  For example, we can suspend or terminate any Service for the following: (a) failure to have or maintain an appropriate account balance for applicable charges; (b) harassing/threatening/abusing/offending our employees or agents; (c) providing false or inaccurate information; (d) interfering with our operations; (e) using/suspicion of using Services in any manner restricted by or inconsistent with the Agreement and Policies; (f) breaching, failing to follow, or abusing the Agreement or Policies; (g) modifying a Device from its manufacturer specifications (for example, rooting the device); or (h) if we believe the action protects our interests, any customer's interests, or our networks.</p>

        <p><strong>Your Right To Change Services & When Changes Are Effective</strong><br>
        The account holder can typically change Services upon request. In some instances, changes may be conditioned on payment of certain charges. The effective date of any changes will depend on our Policies, the old Services, and the requested Services. We will not credit or refund any subscription or other charges as a result of a change in Services. We may, but are not obligated to, provide you the opportunity to authorize someone else to make changes to your Services. You are responsible for any changes to your Services made by a person you authorize, and those changes will be treated as modifications to this Agreement.</p>

        <p><strong>Restrictions On Using Services</strong><br>
        You can't use our Services: (a) in a way that could cause damage or adversely affect any of our other customers or our reputation, networks, property, or Services; or (b) in any way prohibited by the terms of our Services, the Agreement, or our Policies. You cannot in any manner resell the Services to another party. For additional restrictions on the use of our Services, see our Acceptable Use Policy and Visitors Agreement, which are available on our website, and the detailed plan or other information on Services that we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Your Device, Number, & Email Address</strong><br>
        We don't manufacture any Device that we might sell to you or that is associated with our Services, and we aren't responsible for any defects, acts, or omissions of the manufacturer. <strong>The only warranties on your Device are the limited warranties given to you by the manufacturer directly or that we pass through. Device performance may vary based on device specifications (for example, a device's software, memory, and storage), and device performance may impact access to all of our Services.</strong> This Device is sold exclusively for use with our Service and in other coverage areas that we may make available to you. As programmed, it will not accept wireless service from another carrier. Except for any legal right you may have to port/transfer your phone number to another carrier, you have noâ€”and cannot gain any (for example, through publication, use, etc.)â€”proprietary, ownership, or other rights to any phone number, identification number, email address, or other identifier that we assign to you, your Device, or your account. We'll notify you if we decide to change or reassign them.</p>

        <p><strong>Porting/Transferring Phone Numbers</strong><br>
        We don't guarantee that number transfers to or from us will be successful. If you authorize another carrier to transfer a number away from us, then that is considered a request by you to us to terminate all of the Services associated with that number. </p>

        <p><strong>Coverage; Where Your Device Will Work; Service Speeds</strong><br>
        Our coverage maps are available at our authorized retail locations or boostmobile.com. The specific network coverage you get will depend on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and Services you've chosen. <strong>Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Coverage and Service speeds are not guaranteed. Coverage is subject to change without notice. Service speeds may depend on the Service purchased. Actual speeds will vary. Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength, and Service speed is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas thatâ€”along with other factors both within and beyond our control (for example, network problems, network or Internet congestion, software, signal strength, your Device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you access, actions of third parties, etc.) â€”may result in dropped and blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 and GPS navigation, depend on your Device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage.</strong> While your Device is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your Device in any manner until the software update is complete.</p>

        <p><strong>Roaming</strong>
        The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that we may make available to you based on our agreements with other carriers. These agreements may change from time to time, and roaming coverage is subject to change without notice. Your ability to receive roaming coverage depends on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and the availability of roaming coverage. We make no guarantee that roaming coverage will be available. Roaming coverage may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas. Your Device will generally indicate when you're roaming. Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of minutes used while roaming may apply. Certain Services may not be available or work the same when roaming (for example, data Services, voicemail, call waiting, etc.).  For information on whether roaming applies, see your service plan details.</p>

        <p><strong>About Data Services & Content</strong><br>
        Our data Services and your Device may allow you to access the Internet, text, pictures, video, games, graphics, music, email, applications, sound, and other materials ("Data Content") or send Data Content elsewhere. Some Data Content is available from us or our vendors, while other Data Content can be accessed from others (for example, third party websites, games, ringers, applications, etc.). We make absolutely no guarantees about the Data Content that you access on your Device. <strong>Data Content may be: (1) unsuitable for children/minors; (2) unreliable or inaccurate; or (3) offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You're solely responsible for evaluating the Data Content accessed by you or anyone through your Services. We strongly recommend that you monitor data usage by children/minors.</strong> Data Content from third parties may also harm your Device or its software. We are not responsible for any Data Content. We are not responsible for any damage caused by any Data Content that you access through your Services, that you load on your Device, or that you request that our representatives access or load on your Device. To protect our networks and Services or for other reasons, we may place restrictions on accessing certain Data Content (such as certain websites, applications, etc.); impose separate charges; limit throughput or the amount of data that you can transfer; or otherwise limit or terminate Services. If we provide you storage for Data Content that you have purchased, then we may delete the Data Content without notice or place restrictions/limits on the use of storage areas. Data Content stored on a Device, transmitted over our networks, or stored by Boost may be deleted, modified, or damaged. You may not be able to make or receive voice calls while using data Services. Data Content provided by our vendors or third parties is subject to cancellation or termination at any time without notice to you, and you may not receive a refund for any unused portion of the Data Content.</p>

        <p><strong>Specific Terms & Restrictions On Using Data Services</strong><br>
        In addition to the rules for using all of our other Services, unless we identify the Service or Device that you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, wireless routers, Data Link, etc.), you can't use our data Services: (1) with server devices or host computer applications, or other systems that drive continuous, heavy traffic or data sessions; (2) as a substitute or backup for private lines or frame relay connections; or (3) for any other unintended use as we determine in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to limit, suspend, or constrain any heavy, continuous data usage that adversely impacts our networks' performance or hinders access to our networks. If your Services include Web or data access, you also can't use your Device as a modem for computers or other equipment, unless we identify the Service or Device you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, with "phone as modem" plans, mobile broadband card plans, wireless router plans, etc.).</p>

        <p><strong>Software License</strong><br>
        If Boost provides you software as part of the Service and there are not software license terms provided with the software (by Boost or by a third party), then Boost grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the software to access the Services for your own individual use. You will not sell, resell, transfer, copy, translate, publish, create derivative works of, make any commercial use of, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software. Boost may revoke this license at any time.</p>

        <p><strong>Fees, Activation & Miscellaneous Charges</strong><br>
        Based on our Policies, we may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain Services. Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, handset upgrades, etc.). You will be provided notice of these types of fees before we complete the requested transaction.</p>

        <p><strong>Usage Charges</strong><br>
        The types of charges that you incur will vary depending on the Service used and your service plan. <strong>You are responsible for the Services on your account and associated charges, including charges made by a person you permit to have direct or indirect access to your device even if you did not authorize its use.</strong> Charges may include, but are not limited to, prepayment for service charges; charges for additional services; and taxes, surcharges, and fees associated with your Services. For the actual usage charges applicable to your Service, see the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction or on our website. Depending on your Services, charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, data calls, texts, and Web access. If you (the account holder) allow end users to access or use your Device, you authorize end users to access, download, and use Services. You will generally be charged for use of Services before or at the time of use in accordance with your service plan. In certain instances, we may charge at some point after you use the Service. Rates that vary based on the time of access will be determined based on the location of the network equipment providing service and not the location of your Device or your Device's area code (if applicable). Charges are generally deducted from your account balance (for example, pay-per-use charges, subscription charges, etc.), though in some instances you may be able to pay for certain Services through a credit card, debit card, or other payment method. If you have incurred charges or fees that were not charged prior to your account balance reaching a zero balance, we may deduct these outstanding, unpaid charges and fees from any subsequent amounts you add to your account balance.</p>

        <p><strong>Types of Charges</strong><br>
        We typically assess the following types of charges: (1) "pay-per-use charges," which are charges assessed each time a Service is used; (2) "subscription charges," which are charges that allow you access to a Service or provide you a certain amount of use of a Service for a defined period of time. Subscription charges for Services end at 11:59 p.m., in the time zone in which your phone number is based, on the last day of your subscription period. Also, depending on your Service, certain types of subscription charges may be assessed automatically upon activation and automatically assessed for subsequent subscription periods; and (3) "download charges," which are charges assessed when you download or access content, which we collect on behalf of ourselves or third-party content providers.</p>

        <p><strong>How We Calculate Your Charges </strong><br>
        <strong>Regular Voice Calls:</strong> We round up partial minutes of use to the next full minute. Time starts when you press "Talk" or your Device connects to the network and stops when you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. You're charged for all calls that connect, even to answering machines, voicemail, or voice transcription services. You won't be charged for unanswered calls or if you get a busy signal. For incoming calls answered, you're charged from the time shortly before the Device starts ringing until you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. You're charged for the entire call based on the rate that applies to the time period in which the call starts. However, the types of charges actually deducted from your account balance will vary depending on your Service. Call time data displayed on your Device may be inaccurate and may not be relied upon for determining charges to your account. Call time for a single call may be limited. If the call exceeds the limit, then it may be automatically terminated.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Usage:</strong> Depending on your Service, you may be charged for data usage. Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, data usage is measured in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytesâ€”not in minutes/time. 1024 bytes equals 1 kilobyte ("KB"), 1024 KB equals 1 megabyte, and 1024 megabytes equals 1 gigabyte. Bytes are rounded up to KB, so you will be charged at least 1 KB for each data usage session ("data session"). Rounding occurs at the end of each data session and sometimes during a data session. Depending on your data Services, usage may be charged against an allowance or on a fixed price per KB, and you may be subject to limitations on the amount of data usage. If you are charged on a fixed price per KB, any fractional cents will be rounded up to the next cent. You are charged for all data directed to your Device's Internet address, including data sessions you did not initiate and for incomplete transfers. As long as your Device is connected to our data networks, you may incur data charges. Examples of data for which you will be charged includes the size of a requested file or Data Content (game, ringer, etc.); Web page graphics (logos, pictures, banners, advertisement, etc.); additional data used in accessing, transporting, and routing the file on our network; data from partial or interrupted downloads; re-sent data; and data associated with unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications. These data charges are in addition to any charges for the Data Content itself (game, ringer, etc.). Data used and charged to you will vary widely, even between identical actions or data sessions. Estimates of data usageâ€”for example, the size of downloadable filesâ€”are not reliable predictors of actual usage.</p>

        <p><strong>Taxes & Government Fees</strong><br>
        You agree to pay all federal, state, and local taxes, fees, and other assessments that we're required by law to collect and remit to the government on the Services that we provide to you. These charges may change from time to time without advance notice.</p>

        <p><strong>Surcharges</strong><br>
        You agree to pay all Boost surcharges ("Surcharges"), which may include, but are not limited to: Federal Universal Service; Regulatory and Administrative charges; gross receipts charges, and other charges. <strong>Surcharges are <em>not</em> taxes, and we are not required by law to assess them. They are part of our rates we choose, at our discretion, to collect from you to recover certain costs, and are kept by us. The number and type of Surcharges will be provided and may vary depending upon the location of the transaction or the primary account address of the payment method or Device and can change over time. We determine the amount for these charges, and these amounts are subject to change as are the components used to calculate these amounts.</strong> We will provide you notice of any changes to Surcharges in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section). However, because some Surcharges are based on amounts set by the government or based on government formulas, it will not always be possible to provide advance notice of new Surcharges or changes in the amount of existing Surcharges. Information on Surcharges is provided during the sales transaction and is available on our website.</p>

        <p><strong>Disputing Charges</strong><br>
        Any dispute to a charge that we assess you must be made in writing within 60 days of the date we deduct the charge from your account balance. You accept all charges not properly disputed within the above time period.</p>

        <p><strong>About Account Balances</strong><br>
        To keep your account active and avoid service interruptions, you must either maintain a positive account balance at all times or pay any applicable subscription charges (depending on your service plan). Account balances are not transferable, redeemable for cash, or refundable; that is, once you make payment on your account, you are provided a credit on your account that can only be used to pay for our Services during the effective period, which varies depending on your service plan.  Positive account balances are forfeited if they are not used within the effective period specified in your service plan (if you properly replenish your account balance during the effective period, the effective period restarts). <strong>If you do not use your account balance during the effective period, your account balance will expire and you will not be entitled to a refund or service credit.</strong> Your Service will be interrupted if you fail to maintain a positive account balance or timely pay applicable subscription charges for each effective period. When this service interruption occurs, you will be given a period of time (which varies depending on your service plan) to make any appropriate payments on your account. <strong>If you do not make such payments within this time period, your account will be cancelled. If your account is cancelled, you will lose any phone number, identification number, or email address associated with your account. Reactivation fees will apply if you choose to restart Service after cancellation.</strong> There may be limits over which your account balance may not exceed. See the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction (also available at <a href="boostmobile.com" target="_blank">boostmobile.com</a>) for the account status rules that apply to your Service.</p>

        <p><strong>Switching between Service Plans</strong><br>
        Unless otherwise provided in the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction, you may switch to any current service plan. If you switch service plans, you may not receive a refund of any portion of any previously paid service charges and you may lose all of your remaining unused minutes, messages, and data allotment. Some service plans are available only on certain phones. Check boostmobile.com for details and options.</p>

        <p><strong>No Refunds of Re-Boost and Monthly Charges</strong><br>
        We are not responsible for, nor do we refund, lost, stolen, misused, or damaged Re-Boost cards. We do not accept returns of or provide refunds for Re-Boost cards. Please ask your retailer any questions regarding its return policy. Re-Boost cards must be applied to your account within the time specified on the card. All Re-Boost sales are final and non-refundable regardless of who uses or possesses your mobile phone or Device after you purchase services, and regardless of whether the mobile phone or Device is used with your consent or knowledge.</p>

        <p><strong>Establishing or Replenishing Account Balances</strong><br>
        Information on how you can establish and maintain an account balance will be provided at activation and is also available at boostmobile.com or through Boost Customer Care. The replenishment methods available to you will depend on the terms of your Services. A fee may apply to certain replenishment methods. Some service plans may provide for automatic account balance replenishment through, for example, automatic billing to a credit card or debit card or automatic debit from an eligible account with a financial institution. Payment through these methods may be subject to limitations, including, but not limited to, the number of times an account may be debited or charged in a particular time period; the amount that may be debited or charged from an account; or other limitations imposed by us or the financial institution that holds the account.</p>

        <p><strong>Protecting Our Networks & Services</strong><br>
        We can take any action to: (1) protect our networks, our rights and interests, or the rights of others; or (2) optimize or improve the overall use of our networks and Services. Some of these actions may interrupt or prevent legitimate communications and usageâ€”for example, message filtering/blocking software to prevent spam or viruses; limiting throughput; limiting access to certain websites, applications or other Data Content; prohibitions on unintended uses (for example, use as a dedicated line or use as a monitoring service); etc. For additional information on what we do to protect our customers, networks, Services and equipment, see our Acceptable Use Policy and Visitors Agreement at our website.</p>

        <p><strong>Your Privacy</strong><br>
        Our Privacy Policy is available at boostmobile.com/privacy. This policy may change from time to time, so review it with regularity and care.</p>

        <p><strong>Call Monitoring:</strong> To ensure the quality of our Services and for other lawful purposes, we may monitor or record calls you make to us or we make to you (for example, your conversations with our customer service or sales departments).</p>

        <p><strong>Authentication and Contact:</strong> You (the account holder) may password protect your account information by establishing a personal identification number ("PIN"). You may also set a backup security question and answer in the event you forget your PIN. You agree to protect your PIN, passwords, and other account access credentials like your backup security question from loss or disclosure. You further agree that Boost may, in our sole discretion, treat any person who presents your credentials that we deem sufficient for account access as you or an authorized user on the account for disclosure of information or changes in Service. You agree that we may contact you for Service-related reasons through the contact information that you provide, through the Services or Devices to which you subscribe, or through other available means, including text message, email, fax, recorded message, mobile, residential or business phone, or mail.</p>

        <p><strong>CPNI:</strong> As we provide telecommunications products and Services to you (the account holder), we develop information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location, and destination of telecommunications products and Services you use, as well as some other information found on your bill ("CPNI"). Under federal law, you have the right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI. For example, we implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI, including authentication procedures when you contact us. For some accounts with a dedicated Boost representative, we may rely on contacting your pre-established point of contact as the standard authentication measure.</p>

        <p><strong>Third-Party Applications:</strong> If you use a third-party application, the application may access, collect, use, or disclose your personal information or require Boost to disclose your informationâ€”including location information (when applicable)â€”to the application provider or some other third party. If you access, use, or authorize third-party applications through the Services, you agree and authorize Boost to provide information related to your use of the Services or the application(s). You understand that your use of third-party applications is subject to the third party's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. Be sure that you have reviewed and are comfortable with the third party's policies before using its application on your device.</p>

        <p><strong>Information on Devices:</strong> Your Device may contain sensitive or personal information (for example, pictures, videos, passwords, or stored credit card numbers). Boost is not responsible for any information on your Device, including sensitive or personal information. If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your Device is out of your possession or control, for example, when you relinquish, exchange, return, or recycle your Device. By submitting your Device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on your Device. If you exchange, return, or recycle your Device through us, we typically attempt to erase all data on your Device, but you must remove all data from your Device before you provide it to us.</p>

        <p><strong>Location-Enabled Services</strong><br>
        Our networks generally know the location of your Device when it is outdoors and/or turned on. By using various technologies to locate your Device, we can provide enhanced emergency 911 services and optional location-enabled services provided by us or a third party. Network coverage or environmental factors (such as structures, buildings, weather, geography, landscape, and topography) can significantly impact the ability to access your Device's location information and use of location-enabled services.</p>

        <p>You agree that any authorized user may access, use, or authorize Boost or third-party location-enabled applications through the Services. You understand that your use of such location-enabled applications is subject to the application's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. If you activate location-enabled services for devices used by other authorized users, you agree to inform the authorized user(s) of the terms of use for location-enabled applications and that the Device may be located.</p>

        <p><strong>911 Or Other Emergency Calls</strong><br>
        <strong>Public safety officials advise that when making 911 or other emergency calls, you should always be prepared to provide your location information.</strong> Unlike traditional wireline phones, depending on a number of factors (for example, whether your Device is GPS-enabled, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 911 operators may not know your phone number, your location, or the location of your Device. In certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers. Enhanced 911 service ("E911")â€”where enabled by local emergency authoritiesâ€”uses GPS technology to provide location information. Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information. If your Device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located. Some Devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911â€”you should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing interactive voice response systems to screen calls.</p>

        <p><strong>If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen</strong><br>
        Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen so we can freeze your account. You may be responsible for usage charges before you notify us of the alleged loss or theft. You agree to cooperate if we choose to investigate the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.). We may not credit or refund any account balance if you choose to terminate Services as a result of loss or theft of your Device. If you do not either activate a new device or notify us that you have found your Device within 60 days from the date we froze your account, your account will be deactivated, we may assess a charge equal to the balance in your account (which is not refundable), and, if applicable, you will lose your phone number.</p>

        <p><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong><br>
        UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN WRITING OTHERWISE, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE CONCERNING YOUR SERVICES (INCLUDING YOUR DEVICE AND ANY SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS ON YOUR DEVICE). WE DONâ€™T PROMISE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICES AND DONâ€™T AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO MAKE WARRANTIES ON OUR BEHALF. BOOST PROVIDES ALL SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS ON AN â€œAS ISâ€� BASIS WITH ALL FAULTS, ERRORS, AND DEFECTS.</p>

        <p><strong>You Agree That We Are Not Responsible For Certain Problems</strong><br>
        You agree that neither we nor our parent, subsidiary, or affiliate companies, nor our vendors, suppliers, or licensors are responsible for any damages, delay, interruption or other failure to perform resulting from: (a) anything done or not done by someone else; (b) providing or failing to provide Services, including, but not limited to, deficiencies or problems with a Device or network coverage (for example, dropped, blocked, interrupted Services, etc.); (c) traffic or other accidents, or any health-related claims relating to our Services; (d) Data Content or information accessed while using our Services; (e) an interruption or failure in accessing or attempting to access emergency services from a Device, including through 911, Enhanced 911 or otherwise; (f) interrupted, failed, or inaccurate location information services; (g) information or communication that is blocked by a spam filter; (h) damage to your Device or any computer or equipment connected to your Device, or damage to or loss of any information stored on your Device, computer, equipment, or Boost storage space from your use of the Services or from viruses, worms, or downloads of malicious content, materials, data, text, images, video, or audio; or (i) things beyond our control, including acts of God (for example, weather-related phenomena, fire, earthquake, hurricane, etc.), riot, strike, war, terrorism, or government orders or acts. You should implement appropriate safeguards to secure your Device, computer, or equipment and to backup your information stored on each.</p>

        <p><strong>You Agree That Our Liability Is Limited - No Consequential Damages</strong><br>
        TO THE EXTEND ALLOWED BY LAW, OUR LIABILITY FOR MONETARY DAMAGES FOR ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THE PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE SERVICE CHARGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AFFECTED PERIOD. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH A DEVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.</p>

        <div class="modalInner">
          <center><p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</strong></p></center>

          <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</strong><br>
          In those rare instances where your concern is not resolved to your satisfaction through calls to our customer care, you and Boost each agree to try to resolve those disputes in good faith after you provide written notice of the dispute as set forth below. If the dispute is not resolved, you and Boost agree that the dispute will be resolved through individual binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of courts of general jurisdiction.</p>

          <p><strong>Mandatory Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action</strong><br>
          <strong>Instead of suing in court, you and Boost agree to arbitrate all Disputes (as defined below) on an individual, non-representative, basis. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Boost are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative action. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.</strong> In arbitration, there is no judge or jury. Instead Disputes are decided by a neutral third-party arbitrator in a more informal process than in court. In arbitration, there is limited discovery and the arbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms of the Agreement and can award damages and relief, including any attorneys' fees authorized by law. </p>

          <p>"Disputes" shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way our Services or the Agreement, including, but not limited to, coverage, Devices, billing services and practices, policies, contract practices (including enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, even if the claim arises after Services have terminated. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) you or an authorized or unauthorized user of the Services or Devices bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; (b) you bring against a third party, such as a retailer or equipment manufacturer, that are based on, relate to, or arise out of in any way our Services or the Agreement; or (c) that Boost brings against you. Disputes also include, but are not limited to, (i) claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Boost, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before this Agreement or out of a prior Agreement with Boost; (iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or class member; and/or (iv) claims that arise after the termination of this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>Dispute Notice and Dispute Resolution Period</strong><br>
          Before initiating an arbitration or a small claims matter, you and Boost each agree to first provide to the other a written notice ("Notice of Dispute"), which shall contain: (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; and (b) a statement of the specific relief sought. A Notice of Dispute to Boost should be sent to: <em>General Counsel; Arbitration Office; 12502 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mailstop VARESA0202-2C682; Reston, Virginia 20191.</em> Boost will provide a Notice of Dispute to you in accordance with the "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section of this Agreement. Boost will assign a representative to work with you and try to resolve your Dispute to your satisfaction. You and Boost agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration or small claims action. If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or Boost may commence an arbitration proceeding or small claims action.</p>

          <p><strong>Arbitration Terms, Process, Rules and Procedures</strong><br>
          (1) Unless you and Boost agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in the county of the last billing address of the Service. The arbitration will be governed by either: (a) rules that we mutually agree upon; or (b) the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures (the "JAMS Rules"), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules about the filing, administration, discovery and arbitrator fees. The JAMS rules are available on its website at jamsadr.com. Notwithstanding any JAMS Rule to the contrary or any other provision in arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern the arbitration, we each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide, except that only a court (and not the arbitrator) shall decide any disagreements regarding the scope and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.</p>

          <p>(2) The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision. We each agree that the FAA's provisionsâ€”not state lawâ€”govern all questions of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the "Minimum Standards"), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply. However, nothing in this paragraph will require or allow you or Boost to arbitrate on a class-wide, representative or consolidated basis.</p>

          <p>(3) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. <strong>YOU AND BOOST AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, unless both you and Boost expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If any portion of this provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>

          <p>(4) We each are responsible for our respective costs, including our respective counsel, experts, and witnesses. Boost will pay for any filing or case management fees associated with the arbitration and the professional fees for the arbitrator's services.</p>

          <p>(5) An arbitrator's award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim and will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions which form the basis of the award. The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some limited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>(6) As an alternative to arbitration, we may resolve Disputes in small claims court in the county of your most recent billing address. In addition, this arbitration agreement does not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Boost on your behalf.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>No Trial By Jury and No Class Action</strong><br>
        IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS AN ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDING, WE EACH AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL OR CLASS ACTION AND WE EACH UNCONDITIONALLY (1) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND (2) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS, INCLUDING JOINING A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>

        <p><strong>Indemnification</strong><br>
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Boost and our subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, vendors, suppliers, and licensors harmless from any claims arising out of or relating to your actions, including, but not limited to, your use of the Service and any information you submit, post, transmit, or make available via the Service; failing to provide appropriate notices regarding location-enabled services (see "Location-Enabled Services" section); failure to safeguard your passwords, backup question to your shared secret question, or other account information; or violating this Agreement or any policy referenced in this Agreement, any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party.</p>

        <p><strong>Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement</strong><br>
        Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, you must deliver written notice to us by mail to Attn: Boost, NSSG SBU, 1084 Laurel Rd., London, KY 40744 or email to <a href="mailto:Boostmobilecustomerassistance@boostmobile.com">Boostmobilecustomerassistance@boostmobile.com</a>. We will provide you notice by correspondence to your last known address in our records, to any fax number or email address you've provided us, by calling you on your Device or any other phone number you've provided us, by voice message on your Device or any other phone number you've provided us, or by text message on your Device.</p>

        <p><strong>Other Important Terms</strong><br>
        Subject to federal law or unless the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, this Agreement is governed solely by the laws of the state encompassing the area code assigned to your Device, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of that state. If either of us waives or doesn't enforce a requirement under this Agreement in an instance, we don't waive our right to later enforce that requirement. Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, if any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the rest of this Agreement remains in full force and effect. This Agreement isn't for the benefit of any third party except our corporate parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and predecessors and successors in interest. You can't assign the Agreement or any of your rights or duties under it unless we agree to the assignment. We can assign the Agreement without notice. You cannot in any manner resell Devices or Services to another party. You cannot export any Device. The Agreement and the documents it incorporates make up the entire agreement between us and replaces all prior written or spoken agreementsâ€”you can't rely on any contradictory documents or statements by sales or service representatives. The rights, obligations, and commitments in the Agreement thatâ€”by their natureâ€”would logically continue beyond the termination of Services (for example, those relating to billing, payment, 911, dispute resolution, no class action, no jury trial) survive termination of Services.</p>

          <p><strong>The Service Agreement</strong></p>
          <p>These Ts&amp;Cs are part of your service agreement with us (the "Agreement") and constitute a contract under which we provide you Services under terms and conditions that you accept. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WITH A CLASS WAIVER, A REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER, AND A JURY WAIVER PROVISION. In addition to these Ts&amp;Cs, there are several parts of the Agreement, which includes but is not limited to the following:  (i) the subscriber agreement and transaction materials that you receive and accept;   (ii) the plan(s) that you chose as set forth in our written services and transaction materials that we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction, including on-line and telephone transactions (if your service plan is not specifically set forth in any in-store brochure or printed materials, the requirements and terms set forth in the current Agreement and transaction materials apply);   (iii) any confirmation materials that we may provide to you; and (iv) the terms set forth in the coverage map brochures. It is important that you carefully read all of the terms of the Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>Additional Terms</strong></p> 
          <p>Additional terms will apply when you use certain applications, programs, Devices, and services, and these terms will be provided to you prior to your use of the items. 	Depending on who provides the items, the terms may come from Sprint Prepaid or a third party.  You are subject to any terms provided by the third party, and the terms are directly between you and that third party. Sprint Prepaid is not responsible for these third-party items and associated terms.</p>

          <p><strong>Our Policies</strong></p>
          <p>Services are subject to our business policies, practices, and procedures ("Policies"). You agree to adhere to all of our Policies when you use our Services. Our Policies are subject to change at any time with or without notice.</p>

          <p><strong>When You Accept The Agreement</strong></p>
          <p>You must have the legal capacity to accept the Agreement. You accept the Agreement when you do any of the following: (a) accept the Agreement through any printed, oral, or electronic statement, for example, on the Web by electronically marking that you have reviewed and accepted; (b) attempt to or in any way use the Services;  (c) pay for the Services; or (d) open any package or start any program that says you are accepting the Agreement when doing so. If you don't want to accept the Agreement, don't do any of these things.</p>

          <p><strong>Service Activation </strong></p>
          <p>To activate the Service, you must both activate your account and establish an appropriate account balance to pay for pay-per-use charges and applicable subscription charges (defined in the "Types of Charges" section) based on the service plan you select. To establish an account balance, pay a subscription charge, or make any other appropriate payments, follow the instructions provided with the equipment; at sprint.com/prepaid; or through Sprint Prepaid Customer Care.</p>

          <p><strong>Our Right To Change The Agreement &amp; Your Related Rights</strong></p>
          <p>We may change any part of the Agreement at any time, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, how we calculate charges, discounts, coverage, technologies used to provide services, or your terms of Service. If you lose your eligibility for a particular rate plan or if a particular rate plan is no longer supported or available, we may change your rate plan to one for which you qualify. We will provide you notice of material changesâ€”and we may provide you notice of non-material changesâ€”in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section). If you continue to access or use our Services or increase your account balance on or after the effective date of a change, you accept the change. Do not access or use our Services after the effective date of a change if you decide to reject the change and terminate Service. You will not be entitled to any credit for the unused portion of your account balance if you decide to terminate Service in response to a change to the Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>Our Right To Suspend Or Terminate Services</strong></p>
          <p>We can, without notice, suspend or terminate any Service at any time for any reason. For example, we can suspend or terminate any Service for the following: (a) failure to have or maintain an appropriate account balance for applicable charges; (b) harassing/threatening/abusing/offending our employees or agents; (c) providing false or inaccurate information; (d) interfering with our operations; (e) using/suspicion of using Services in any manner restricted by or inconsistent with the Agreement and Policies; (f) breaching, failing to follow, or abusing the Agreement or Policies; (g) modifying a Device from its manufacturer specifications (for example, rooting the device); or (h) if we believe the action protects our interests, any customer's interests, or our networks. </p>

          <p><strong>Your Right To Change Services &amp; When Changes Are Effective</strong></p> 
          <p>The account holder can typically change Services upon request. In some instances, changes may be conditioned on payment of certain charges. The effective date of any changes will depend on our Policies, the old Services, and the requested Services.  We will not credit or refund any subscription or other charges as a result of a change in Services.  We mayâ€”but are not obligated toâ€”provide you the opportunity to authorize someone else to make changes to your Services. You are responsible for any changes to your Services made by a person you authorize, and those changes will be treated as modifications to this Agreement.</p>

          <p><strong>Restrictions On Using Services</strong></p> 
          <p>You can't use our Services: (a) in a way that could cause damage or adversely affect any of our other customers or our reputation, networks, property, or Services; or (b) in any way prohibited by the terms of our Services, the Agreement, or our Policies. You cannot in any manner resell the Services to another party. For additional restrictions on the use of our Services, see our Acceptable Use Policy and Visitors Agreement, which are available on our website, and the detailed plan or other information on Services that we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction.</p>

          <p><strong>Your Device, Number, &amp; Email Address</strong></p>
          <p>We don't manufacture any Device that we might sell to you or that is associated with our Services, and we aren't responsible for any defects, acts, or omissions of the manufacturer. The only warranties on your Device are the limited warranties given to you by the manufacturer directly or that we pass through. Device performance may vary based on device specifications (for example, a device's software, memory, and storage), and device performance may impact access to all of our Services. This Device is sold exclusively for use with our Service and in other coverage areas that we may make available to you. As programmed, it will not accept wireless service from another carrier. Except for any legal right you may have to port/transfer your phone number to another carrier, you have noâ€”and cannot gain any (for example, through publication, use, etc.)â€”proprietary, ownership, or other rights to any phone number, identification number, email address, or other identifier that we assign to you, your Device, or your account. We'll notify you if we decide to change or reassign them. </p>

          <p><strong>Porting/Transferring Phone Numbers</strong></p>
          <p>We don't guarantee that number transfers to or from us will be successful. If you authorize another carrier to transfer a number away from us, then that is considered a request by you to us to terminate all of the Services associated with that number. </p>

          <p><strong>Coverage; Where Your Device Will Work; Service Speeds</strong></p>
          <p>Our coverage maps are available at our authorized retail locations or sprint.com/prepaidcoverage. The specific network coverage you get will depend on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and Services you've chosen. Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under optimal conditions. Coverage isn't available everywhere. Coverage and Service speeds are not guaranteed. Coverage is subject to change without notice. Service speeds may depend on the Service purchased. Actual speeds will vary. Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength, and Service speed is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas thatâ€”along with other factors both within and beyond our control (for example, network problems, network or Internet congestion, software, signal strength, your Device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you access, actions of third parties, etc.)â€”may result in dropped and blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service. Services that rely on location information, such as E911 and GPS navigation, depend on your Device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. While your Device is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your Device in any manner until the software update is complete.</p>

          <p><strong>Roaming </strong></p>
          <p>The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that we may make available to you based on our agreements with other carriers. These agreements may change from time to time, and roaming coverage is subject to change without notice. Your ability to receive roaming coverage depends on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and the availability of roaming coverage. We make no guarantee that roaming coverage will be available. Roaming coverage may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas. Your Device will generally indicate when you're roaming.   Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of minutes used while roaming may apply. Certain Services may not be available or work the same when roaming (for example, data Services, voicemail, call waiting, etc.). For information on whether roaming applies, see your service plan details. </p>
          <p><strong>About Data Services &amp; Content</strong></p>

          <p>	
          Our data Services and your Device may allow you to access the Internet, text, pictures, video, games, graphics, music, email, applications, sound, and other materials ("Data Content") or send Data Content elsewhere. 
          Some Data Content is available from us or our vendors, while other Data Content can be accessed from others (for example, third party websites, games, ringers, applications, etc.). 
          We make absolutely no guarantees about the Data Content that you access on your Device. 
          Data Content may be: 
          (1) unsuitable for children/minors; 
          (2) unreliable or inaccurate; or 
          (3) offensive, indecent, or objectionable. 
          You're solely responsible for evaluating the Data Content accessed by you or anyone through your Services. 
          We strongly recommend that you monitor data usage by children/minors. 
          Data Content from third parties may also harm your Device or its software. 
          We are not responsible for any Data Content. 
          We are not responsible for any damage caused by any Data Content that you access through your Services, that you load on your Device, or that you request that our representatives access or load on your Device. 
          To protect our networks and Services or for other reasons, we may place restrictions on accessing certain Data Content (such as certain websites, applications, etc.); impose separate charges; limit throughput or the amount of data that you can transfer; or otherwise limit or terminate Services. 
          If we provide you storage for Data Content that you have purchased, then we may delete the Data Content without notice or place restrictions/limits on the use of storage areas. 
          Data Content stored on a Device, transmitted over our networks, or stored by Sprint Prepaid may be deleted, modified, or damaged. 
          You may not be able to make or receive voice calls while using data Services. 
          Data Content provided by our vendors or third parties is subject to cancellation or termination at any time without notice to you, and you may not receive a refund for any unused portion of the Data Content.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Specific Terms &amp; Restrictions On Using Data Services</strong></p>  
          <p>
          In addition to the rules for using all of our other Services, unless we identify the Service or Device that you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, wireless routers, Data Link, etc.), you can't use our data Services: 
          (1) with server devices or host computer applications, or other systems that drive continuous, heavy traffic or data sessions; 
          (2) as a substitute or backup for private lines or frame relay connections; or 
          (3) for any other unintended use as we determine in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to limit, suspend, or constrain any heavy, continuous data usage that adversely impacts our networks' performance or hinders access to our networks. If your Services include Web or data access, you also can't use your Device as a modem for computers or other equipment, unless we identify the Service or Device you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, with "phone as modem" plans, mobile broadband card plans, wireless router plans, etc.).
          </p>
          <p><strong>Software License</strong></p> 
          <p>
          If Sprint Prepaid provides you software as part of the Service and there are not software license terms provided with the software (by Sprint Prepaid or by a third party), then Sprint Prepaid grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the software to access the Services for your own individual use. 
          You will not sell, resell, transfer, copy, translate, publish, create derivative works of, make any commercial use of, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software. Sprint Prepaid may revoke this license at any time.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Fees, Activation &amp; Miscellaneous Charges </strong></p>
          <p>
          Based on our Policies, we may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain Services. 
          Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, handset upgrades, etc.). 
          You will be informed of these types of fees before we complete the requested transaction. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>Usage Charges </strong></p>
          <p>
          The types of charges that you incur will vary depending on the Service used and your service plan. 
          You are responsible for the Services on your account and associated charges, including charges made by a person you permit to have direct or indirect access to your device even if you did not authorize its use. 
          Charges may include, but are not limited to, prepayment for service charges; charges for additional services; and taxes, surcharges, and fees associated with your Services. 
          For the actual usage charges applicable to your Service, see the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction or on our website. 
          Depending on your Services, charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, data calls, texts, international Services, additional voice minutes, premium services (identified at the time of Service activation) and Web access. 
          If you (the account holder) allow end users to access or use your Device, you authorize end users to access, download, and use Services. 
          You will generally be charged for use of Services before or at the time of use in accordance with your service plan. 
          In certain instances, we may charge at some point after you use the Service. 
          Rates that vary based on the time of access will be determined based on the location of the network equipment providing service and not the location of your Device or your Device's area code (if applicable). 
          Charges are generally deducted from your account balance (for example, pay-per-use charges, subscription charges, etc.), though in some instances you may be able to pay for certain Services through a credit card, debit card, or other payment method. 
          If you have incurred charges or fees that were not charged prior to your account balance reaching a zero balance, we may deduct these outstanding, unpaid charges and fees from any subsequent amounts you add to your account balance. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>Types of Charges</strong></p>
          <p>
          We typically assess the following types of charges: 
          (1) "pay-per-use charges," which are charges assessed each time a Service is used;
          (2) "subscription charges," which are charges that allow you access to a Service or provide you a certain amount of use of a Service for a defined period of time. Subscription charges for Services end at 11:59 p.m., in the time zone in which your phone number is based, on the last day of your subscription period. Also, depending on your Service, certain types of subscription charges may be assessed automatically upon activation and automatically assessed for subsequent subscription periods; and
          (3) "download charges," which are charges assessed when you download or access content, which we collect on behalf of ourselves or third-party content providers.
          </p>
          <p><strong>How We Calculate Your Charges </strong></p>
          <p>
          <strong>Regular Voice Calls:</strong> 
          We round up partial minutes of use to the next full minute. 
          Time starts when you press "Talk" or your Device connects to the network and stops when you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. 
          You're charged for all calls that connect, even to answering machines, voicemail, or voice transcription services. 
          You won't be charged for unanswered calls or if you get a busy signal. 
          For incoming calls answered, you're charged from the time shortly before the Device starts ringing until you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. 
          You're charged for the entire call based on the rate that applies to the time period in which the call starts. 
          However, the types of charges actually deducted from your account balance will vary depending on your Service. 
          Call time data displayed on your device may be inaccurate and may not be relied upon for determining charges to your account. 
          Call time for a single call may be subject to a maximum duration and may be automatically terminated if the maximum duration is exceeded.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Data Usage:</strong> 
          Depending on your Service, you may be charged for data usage. 
          Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, data usage is measured in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytesâ€”not in minutes/time. 
          1024 bytes equals 1 kilobyte ("KB"), 1024 KB equals 1 megabyte, and 1024 megabytes equals 1 gigabyte. 
          Bytes are rounded up to KB, so you will be charged at least 1 KB for each data usage session ("data session"). 
          Rounding occurs at the end of each data session and sometimes during a data session. 
          Depending on your data Services, usage may be charged against an allowance or on a fixed price per KB, and you may be subject to limitations on the amount of data usage. 
          If you are charged on a fixed price per KB, any fractional cents will be rounded up to the next cent. 
          You are charged for all data directed to your Device's Internet address, including data sessions you did not initiate and for incomplete transfers. 
          As long as your Device is connected to our data networks, you may incur data charges. 
          Examples of data for which you will be charged includes the size of a requested file or Data Content (game, ringer, etc.); 
          Web page graphics (logos, pictures, banners, advertisement, etc.); additional data used in accessing, transporting, and routing the file on our network; 
          data from partial or interrupted downloads; re-sent data; and data associated with unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications. 
          These data charges are in addition to any charges for the Data Content itself (game, ringer, etc.). 
          Data used and charged to you will vary widely, even between identical actions or data sessions. 
          Estimates of data usageâ€”for example, the size of downloadable filesâ€”are not reliable predictors of actual usage. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>Taxes &amp; Government Fees </strong></p>
          <p>You agree to pay all federal, state, and local taxes, fees, and other assessments that we're required by law to collect and remit to the government on the Services that we provide to you. These charges may change from time to time without advance notice. </p>
          <p><strong>Surcharges</strong></p>
          <p>
          You agree to pay all Sprint Prepaid surcharges ("Surcharges"), which may include, but are not limited to: 
          Federal Universal Service; Regulatory and administrative charges; gross receipts charges, and other charges. 
          Surcharges are not taxes, and we are not required by law to assess them. 
          They are part of our rates we choose, at our discretion, to collect from you to recover certain costs, and are kept by us. 
          The number and type of Surcharges will be provided and may vary depending upon the location of the transaction or the primary account address of the payment method or Device and can change over time. 
          We determine the amount for these charges, and these amounts are subject to change as are the components used to calculate these amounts. 
          We will provide you notice of any changes to Surcharges in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section). 
          However, because some Surcharges are based on amounts set by the government or based on government formulas, it will not always be possible to provide advance notice of new Surcharges or changes in the amount of existing Surcharges. 
          Information on Surcharges is provided during the sales transaction and is available on our website.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Disputing Charges </strong></p>
          <p>Any dispute to a charge that we assess you must be made in writing within 60 days of the date we deduct the charge from your account balance. You accept all charges not properly disputed within the above time period. </p>
          <p><strong>About Account Balances </strong></p>
          <p>To keep your account active and avoid service interruption, you must either maintain a positive account balance at all times or pay any applicable subscription charges, depending on your service plan. Account balances are not transferable, redeemable for cash, or refundable. Charges are deducted from either your account balance or you may be able to pay for certain services with a credit card, debit card or, as available, Paypal account (a "registered payment method").There may be limits on your account administration, for example account balance, number change, and device changes. See the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction (also available at sprint.com/prepaid) for the account status rules that apply to your Service. </p>
          <p><strong>Establishing or Replenishing Account Balances</strong></p>
          <p>Information on how you can establish and maintain an account balance will be provided at activation and is also available at sprint.com/prepaid or through Sprint Prepaid Customer Care. The replenishment methods available to you will depend on the terms of your Services. A fee may apply to certain replenishment methods. Some service plans may provide for automatic account balance replenishment through, for example, automatic billing to a credit card or debit card or automatic debit from an eligible account with a financial institution. Payment through these methods may be subject to limitations, including, but not limited to, the number of times an account may be debited or charged in a particular time period; the amount that may be debited or charged from an account; or other limitations imposed by us or the financial institution that holds the account.</p>
          <p><strong>Switching between Service Plans:</strong> Unless otherwise provided in the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction, you may switch current Sprint Prepaid service plans. When you switch service plans, you will not receive a refund of any portion of any previously paid service charges and you will lose all of your remaining unused minutes, messages, and data allotment. Some service plans are available only on certain phones. Check sprint.com/prepaid for details and options. Repeated switching is not permitted and may result in termination of service. </p>
          <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> We are not responsible for, nor do we refund, lost, stolen, misused, or damaged replenishment cards.  We do not accept returns of or provide refunds for replenishment cards. Please ask your retailer any questions regarding its return policy. Replenishment cards must be applied to your account within the time specified on the card. All replenishment card sales are final and non-refundable regardless of who uses or possesses your mobile phone or device after you purchase services, and regardless of whether the mobile phone or device is used with your consent or knowledge.</p>
          <p><strong>Protecting Our Networks &amp; Services </strong></p>
          <p>We can take any action to: (1) protect our networks, our rights and interests, or the rights of others; or (2) optimize or improve the overall use of our networks and Services. Some of these actions may interrupt or prevent legitimate communications and usageâ€”for example, message filtering/blocking software to prevent spam or viruses; limiting throughput; limiting access to certain websites, applications or other Data Content; prohibitions on unintended uses (for example, use as a dedicated line or use as a monitoring service); etc. For additional information on what we do to protect our customers, networks, Services and equipment, see our Acceptable Use Policy and Visitors Agreement at our website. </p>
          <p><strong>Your Privacy </strong></p>
          <p>Our Privacy Policy is available at sprint.com/legal/privacy.html. This policy may change from time to time, so review it with regularity and care. </p>
          <p><strong>Call Monitoring:</strong> To ensure the quality of our Services and for other lawful purposes, we may monitor or record calls you make to us or we make to you (for example, your conversations with our customer service or sales departments).</p>
          <p><strong>Authentication and Contact:</strong> You (the account holder) must password protect your account information by establishing a personal identification number ("PIN"). You may also set a backup security question and answer in the event you forget your PIN. You agree to protect your PIN, passwords, and other account access credentials like your backup security question from loss or disclosure. You further agree that Sprint Prepaid may, in our sole discretion, treat any person who presents your credentials that we deem sufficient for account access as you or an authorized user on the account for disclosure of information or changes in Service. You agree that we may contact you for Service-related reasons through the contact information that you provide, through the Services or Devices to which you subscribe, or through other available means, including text message, email, fax, recorded message, mobile, residential or business phone, or mail. </p>
          <p><strong>CPNI:</strong> As we provide telecommunications products and Services to you (the account holder), we develop information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location, and destination of telecommunications products and Services you use, as well as some other information found on your bill ("CPNI"). Under federal law, you have the right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI. For example, we implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI, including authentication procedures when you contact us. </p>
          <p><strong>Third-Party Applications:</strong> If you use a third-party application, the application may access, collect, use, or disclose your personal information or require Sprint Prepaid to disclose your informationâ€”including location information (when applicable)â€”to the application provider or some other third party. If you access, use, or authorize third-party applications through the Services, you agree and authorize Sprint Prepaid to provide information related to your use of the Services or the application(s). You understand that your use of third-party applications is subject to the third party's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. Be sure that you have reviewed and are comfortable with the third party's policies before using its application on your device.</p>
          <p><strong>Information on Devices:</strong> Your Device may contain sensitive or personal information (for example, pictures, videos, passwords, or stored credit card numbers). Sprint Prepaid is not responsible for any information on your Device, including sensitive or personal information. If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your Device is out of your possession or control, for example, when you relinquish, exchange, return, or recycle your Device. By submitting your Device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on your Device. If you exchange, return, or recycle your Device through us, you must remove all data from your Device before you submit your Device to us.</p>
          <p><strong>Location-Enabled Services </strong></p>
          <p>Our networks generally know the location of your Device when it is outdoors and/or turned on. By using various technologies to locate your Device, we can provide enhanced emergency 911 services and optional location-enabled services provided by us or a third party. Network coverage or environmental factors (such as structures, buildings, weather, geography, landscape, and topography) can significantly impact the ability to access your Device's location information and use of location-enabled services. </p>
          <p>You agree that any authorized user may access, use, or authorize Sprint Prepaid or third-party location-enabled applications through the Services. You understand that your use of such location-enabled applications is subject to the application's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. If you activate location-enabled services for devices used by other authorized users, you agree to inform the authorized user(s) of the terms of use for location-enabled applications and that the Device may be located. </p>
          <p><strong>911 Or Other Emergency Calls </strong></p>
          <p>
          Public safety officials advise that when making 911 or other emergency calls, you should always be prepared to provide your location information. 
          Unlike traditional wireline phones, depending on a number of factors (for example, whether your Device is GPS-enabled, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 
          911 operators may not know your phone number, your location, or the location of your Device. 
          In certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers. 
          Enhanced 911 service ("E911")â€”where enabled by local emergency authoritiesâ€”uses GPS technology to provide location information. 
          Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information. 
          If your Device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located. 
          Some Devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911â€”you should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing interactive voice response systems to screen calls.
          </p>
          <p><strong>If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen</strong></p> 
          <p>Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen so we can freeze your account. You may be responsible for usage charges before you notify us of the alleged loss or theft. You agree to cooperate if we choose to investigate the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.). We may not credit or refund any account balance if you choose to terminate Services as a result of loss or theft of your Device. If you do not either activate a new device or notify us that you have found your device within 60 days from the date we froze your account, your account will be deactivated, we may assess a charge equal to the balance in your account (which is not refundable), and, if applicable, you will lose your phone number. </p>
          <p><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties </strong></p>	
          <p>UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN WRITING OTHERWISE, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE CONCERNING YOUR SERVICES (INCLUDING YOUR DEVICE AND ANY SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS ON YOUR DEVICE). WE DON'T PROMISE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICES AND DON'T AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO MAKE WARRANTIES ON OUR BEHALF. SPRINT PREPAID PROVIDES ALL SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITH ALL FAULTS, ERRORS, AND DEFECTS.</p>
          <p><strong>You Agree That We Are Not Responsible For Certain Problems </strong></p>
          <p>
          You agree that neither we nor our parent, subsidiary, or affiliate companies, nor our vendors, suppliers, or licensors are responsible for any damages, delay, interruption or other failure to perform resulting from: 
          (a) anything done or not done by someone else; 
          (b) providing or failing to provide Services, including, but not limited to, deficiencies or problems with a Device or network coverage (for example, dropped, blocked, interrupted Services, etc.); 
          (c) traffic or other accidents, or any health-related claims relating to our Services; 
          (d) Data Content or information accessed while using our Services; 
          (e) an interruption or failure in accessing or attempting to access emergency services from a Device, including through 911, Enhanced 911 or otherwise; 
          (f) interrupted, failed, or inaccurate location information services; 
          (g) information or communication that is blocked by a spam filter; 
          (h) damage to your Device or any computer or equipment connected to your Device, or damage to or loss of any information stored on your Device, computer, equipment, or Sprint Prepaid storage space from your use of the Services or from viruses, worms, or downloads of malicious content, materials, data, text, images, video, or audio; or (i) things beyond our control, including acts of God (for example, weather-related phenomena, fire, earthquake, hurricane, etc.), riot, strike, war, terrorism, or government orders or acts. 
          You should implement appropriate safeguards to secure your Device, computer, or equipment and to backup your information stored on each.
          </p>
          <p><strong>You Agree That Our Liability Is Limited - No Consequential Damages</strong></p>
          <p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, OUR LIABILITY FOR MONETARY DAMAGES FOR ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THE PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE SERVICE CHARGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AFFECTED PERIOD. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH A DEVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. </p>
          <p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</strong></p>
          <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>
          <p>In those rare instances where your concern is not resolved to your satisfaction through calls to our customer care, you and Sprint Prepaid each agree to try to resolve those disputes in good faith after you provide written notice of the dispute as set forth below. If the dispute is not resolved, you and Sprint Prepaid agree that the dispute will be resolved through individual binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of courts of general jurisdiction.</p>
          <p><strong>Mandatory Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action</strong></p>
          <p>Instead of suing in court, you and Sprint Prepaid agree to arbitrate all Disputes (as defined below) on an individual, non-representative, basis. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Sprint Prepaid are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative action. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.</p>
          <p>In arbitration, there is no judge or jury. Instead Disputes are decided by a neutral third-party arbitrator in a more informal process than in court. In arbitration, there is limited discovery and the arbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms of the Agreement and can award damages and relief, including any attorneys' fees authorized by law.</p>
          <p>
          "Disputes" shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way our Services or the Agreement, 
          including, but not limited to, coverage, Devices, billing services and practices, policies, contract practices (including enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, 
          even if the claim arises after Services have terminated. 
          Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: 
          (a) you or an authorized or unauthorized user of the Services or Devices bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; 
          (b) you bring against a third party, such as a retailer or equipment manufacturer, that are based on, relate to, or arise out of in any way our Services or the Agreement; or 
          (c) that Sprint Prepaid brings against you. 
          Disputes also include, but are not limited to, 
          (i) claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Sprint Prepaid, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims or any other legal theory; 
          (ii) claims that arose before this Agreement or out of a prior Agreement with Sprint Prepaid; 
          (iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or class member; and/or 
          (iv) claims that arise after the termination of this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Dispute Notice and Dispute Resolution Period</strong></p>
          <p>
          Before initiating an arbitration or a small claims matter, you and Sprint Prepaid each agree to first provide to the other a written notice ("Notice of Dispute"), 
          which shall contain: 
          (a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; and 
          (b) a statement of the specific relief sought. 
          A Notice of Dispute to Sprint Prepaid should be sent to: General Counsel; Arbitration Office; 12502 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mailstop VARESA0202-2C682; Reston, Virginia 20191. 
          Sprint Prepaid will provide a Notice of Dispute to you in accordance with the "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section of this Agreement. 
          Sprint Prepaid will assign a representative to work with you and try to resolve your Dispute to your satisfaction. 
          You and Sprint Prepaid agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration or small claims action. 
          If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or Sprint Prepaid may commence an arbitration proceeding or small claims action.
          </p> 
          <p><strong>Arbitration Terms, Process, Rules and Procedures</strong></p>
          <p>(1) Unless you and Sprint Prepaid agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in the county of the last billing address of the Service. The arbitration will be governed by either: (a) rules that we mutually agree upon; or (b) the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (the "JAMS Rules"), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules about the filing, administration, discovery and arbitrator fees. The JAMS rules are available on its website at jamsadr.com. Notwithstanding any JAMS Rule to the contrary or any other provision in arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern the arbitration, we each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide, except that only a court (and not the arbitrator) shall decide any disagreements regarding the scope and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.</p>
          <p>(2) The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision. We each agree that the FAA's provisionsâ€”not state lawâ€”govern all questions of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the "Minimum Standards"), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply. However, nothing in this paragraph will require or allow you or Sprint Prepaid to arbitrate on a class-wide, representative or consolidated basis. </p>
          <p>(3) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND SPRINT PREPAID AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Sprint Prepaid expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If any portion of this provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
          <p>(4) We each are responsible for our respective costs, including our respective counsel, experts, and witnesses. Sprint Prepaid will pay for any filing or case management fees associated with the arbitration and the professional fees for the arbitrator's services. </p>
          <p>(5) An arbitrator's award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim and will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions which form the basis of the award. The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some limited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>(6) As an alternative to arbitration, we may resolve Disputes in small claims court in the county of your most recent billing address. In addition, this arbitration agreement does not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Sprint Prepaid on your behalf.</p>
          <p><strong>No Trial By Jury and No Class Actions</strong></p>
          <p>IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS AN ACTION, COUTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDING, WE EACH AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL OR CLASS ACTION AND WE EACH UNCONDITIONALLY (1) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND (2) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS, INCLUDING JOINING A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACTITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
          <p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
          <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Sprint Prepaid and our subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, vendors, suppliers, and licensors harmless from any claims arising out of or relating to your actions, including, but not limited to, your use of the Service and any information you submit, post, transmit, or make available via the Service; failing to provide appropriate notices regarding location-enabled services (see "Location-Enabled Services" section); failure to safeguard your passwords, backup question to your shared secret question, or other account information; or violating this Agreement or any policy referenced in this Agreement, any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party.</p>
          <p><strong>Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement </strong></p>
          <p>Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, you must deliver written notice to us by mail to SPP, NSSG SBU 1084 S. Laurel Rd., London, KY 40744. We will provide you notice by correspondence to your last known address in our records, to any fax number or email address you've provided us, by calling you on your Device or any other phone number you've provided us, by voice message on your Device or any other phone number you've provided us, or by text message on your Device. </p>
          <p><strong>Other Important Terms</strong></p>
          <p>
          Subject to federal law or unless the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, this Agreement is governed solely by the laws of the state encompassing the area code assigned to your Device, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of that state. If either of us waives or doesn't enforce a requirement under this Agreement in an instance, we don't waive our right to later enforce that requirement. 
          Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, if any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the rest of this Agreement remains in full force and effect. 
          This Agreement isn't for the benefit of any third party except our corporate parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and predecessors and successors in interest. 
          You can't assign the Agreement or any of your rights or duties under it unless we agree to the assignment. We can assign the Agreement without notice. 
          You cannot in any manner resell Devices or Services to another party. You cannot export any Device. 
          The Agreement and the documents it incorporates make up the entire agreement between us and replaces all prior written or spoken agreementsâ€”you can't rely on any contradictory documents or statements by sales or service representatives. The rights, obligations, and commitments in the Agreement thatâ€”by their natureâ€”would logically continue beyond the termination of Services (for example, those relating to billing, payment, 911, dispute resolution, no class action, no jury trial) survive termination of Services.

          <!--								<p style="font-style: italic;">
          The following terms and conditions are specific to AutoPay payment and are supplemental to (and do not supersede) the Sprint&reg; Prepaid Service Agreement, 
          which includes the Important Service/Product Specific and General Terms and Conditions of Service (available through <a href="//www.sprint.com/prepaidlegal">sprint.com/prepaidlegal</a>), 
          that you received and accepted when you first became a Sprint Prepaid customer. 
          Your continued access to or use of the AutoPay service after the receipt and review hereof constitutes your consent to the terms contained herein and your continued consent to the terms contained in the Service Agreement.

          in the ordinary course of business, Sprint Prepaid may provide information concerning you or your account to third parties. 
          All of these terms and policy are available at <a href="//www.sprint.com/prepaidlegal">sprint.com/prepaidlegal</a>.

          <p>The following "Recurring Terms &amp; Conditions" apply to the Monthly AutoPay payment option. One "Payment-Specific Terms &amp; Conditions" follow these General Terms &amp; Conditions and govern the Monthly AutoPay payment option you selected when you enrolled in AutoPay.</p> -->
          <p><strong>AutoPay terms and conditions</strong></p>
          <p>The following terms and conditions apply if  you are enrolled in Monthly AutoPay. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          You, the Customer, authorize Sprint Prepaid  to on a recurring basis, automatically charge the debit or credit card or  PayPal account you specified for payments due on the Sprint Prepaid account  number you specified at the time of the AutoPay enrollment. These recurring  charges and all other charges to your account are nonrefundable.</p>
          <p>Sprint Prepaid may discontinue processing  of recurring charges if Sprint Prepaid is unable to secure funds from the credit/debit  card or PayPal account for the payments you have authorized due to, but not  limited to, insufficient or uncollected funds in the account or insufficient or  inaccurate information you provided. If a payment is returned for any reason,  you will not be able to use a credit/debit card or PayPal until your account is  in good standing. Sprint Prepaid may, if applicable, undertake collection  action, including application of returned fees to the extent permitted by  law.&nbsp; All such fees may be collected  electronically.&nbsp; TO KEEP YOUR ACCOUNT  ACTIVE AND AVOID SERVICE INTERRUPTION, YOU MUST EITHER MAINTAIN A POSITIVE  ACCOUNT BALANCE AT ALL TIMES OR PAY ANY APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES,  DEPENDING ON YOUR SERVICE PLAN. </p>
          <p>Sprint Prepaid will send a text message  notification to your Sprint Prepaid handset or an email, if an email is  available, 10 days prior to any recurring charges.&nbsp; Sprint Prepaid will also send a notification  10 days prior to any recurring charges that varies in amount from the previous  recurring charge or from the amount you selected and authorized at the time of  the AutoPay enrollment; however, by enrolling in the Auto Pay, you elect to  receive such notice only when a transfer differs from the previous transfer by  more than $10.00.</p>
          <p>You also understand that this authorization  to pay the Sprint Prepaid account number you specified at the time of the  AutoPay enrollment by recurring charges or debits is entirely optional and is  not required to obtain or maintain my account with Sprint Prepaid.<br>
          <br>
          You are responsible for providing Sprint  Prepaid with accurate payment account information if such information changes  in the future. You understand that you may call *2 or access your Sprint  Prepaid account online at www.sprint.com/prepaid three days prior to your  recurring charge scheduled date to update or discontinue AutoPay.&nbsp; Sprint Prepaid will not initiate further  transfers or charges after you have cancelled AutoPay and Sprint Prepaid has  had a reasonable period of time to process your request. </p>
          <p><strong><u>If you are enrolled in the Monthly AutoPay  option, the following applies to you:</u></strong> <br>
          You will be automatically charged for  any monthly recurring charges, bold-ons, and add-ons, plus any applicable sales  and local taxes, every month on your payment due date.

            <p><strong>Su dispositivo, nÃºmero y direcciÃ³n de e-mail</strong></p>
            <p>No fabricamos ningÃºn Dispositivo que pudiÃ©ramos venderle a usted o que estÃ© relacionado con nuestros servicios, y no somos responsables por ningÃºn defecto, acto u omisiÃ³n del fabricante. <strong>Las Ãºnicas garantÃ­as para su Dispositivo son las garantÃ­as limitadas que le  haya dado a usted directamente el fabricante o que nosotros hayamos  transferido.</strong> <strong>El funcionamiento del Dispositivo puede variar dependiendo  de las especificaciones del mismo (por ejemplo, el software, la memoria y el  almacenamiento de un dispositivo), y el funcionamiento del dispositivo puede  afectar el acceso a todos nuestros servicios.</strong> Este dispositivo se vende exclusivamente para su uso con nuestro servicio y en otras Ã¡reas de cobertura que podemos poner a su disposiciÃ³n. En la forma en la que estÃ¡ programado no va a aceptar servicio mÃ³vil de otro proveedor. Excepto en el caso de algÃºn derecho legal que usted tenga de transportar/transferir su nÃºmero telefÃ³nico a otro proveedor, no obtiene ningÃºn beneficio -- y no puede obtener beneficio alguno (por ejemplo, por medio de la publicaciÃ³n, el uso, etc.) -- sobre la pertenencia, posesiÃ³n u otros derechos de ningÃºn nÃºmero telefÃ³nico, nÃºmero de identificaciÃ³n, direcciÃ³n de e-mail u otro identificador que le asignemos a usted, a su Dispositivo o a su cuenta. Le notificaremos si decidimos cambiarlos o reasignarlos. </p>
            <p><strong>Transporte/transferencia de nÃºmeros telefÃ³nicos</strong></p>
            <p>No le garantizamos que las transferencias de nÃºmeros a nosotros o de nosotros a otros tendrÃ¡n Ã©xito. Si autoriza a otra empresa de telefonÃ­a a que transfiera un nÃºmero que tenÃ­a con nosotros hacia ella, este acto se considera como su solicitud a nosotros de dar por terminados todos los servicios relacionados con ese nÃºmero.</p>
            <p><strong>Cobertura; dÃ³nde funcionarÃ¡ su  dispositivo; velocidades de servicio</strong></p>
            <p>Nuestros mapas de cobertura estÃ¡n disponibles en nuestras tiendas autorizadas de menudeo y en sprint.com/prepaidcoverage1.&nbsp; La cobertura de red especÃ­fica que usted tenga dependerÃ¡ de las transmisiones de radio que pueda captar su Dispositivo y de los servicios que haya elegido. <strong>Nuestros mapas de cobertura proporcionan  estimaciones de alto nivel de  nuestras Ã¡reas de cobertura  cuando utilice los servicios al aire libre bajo condiciones Ã³ptimas. &nbsp;La cobertura no estÃ¡ disponible en todas  partes.</strong> <strong>La cobertura y las velocidades de servicio no estÃ¡n  garantizadas.</strong> <strong>La cobertura estÃ¡ sujeta a cambio sin previo aviso.</strong> <strong>Las  velocidades de servicio pueden depender del servicio comprado.</strong> <strong>Las  velocidades reales pueden variar.</strong> <strong>La estimaciÃ³n de la cobertura mÃ³vil y  de la intensidad de la seÃ±al y la velocidad del servicio no es una ciencia  exacta..</strong> <strong>E</strong><strong>xisten zonas sin cobertura  en nuestras Ã¡reas de cobertura estimada que, aunadas a otros factores que estÃ¡n bajo nuestro control o fuera  de Ã©l (por ejemplo, problemas de red, congestiÃ³n en la red o en Internet,  software, intensidad de la seÃ±al, su Dispositivo, estructuras, edificios,  clima, caracterÃ­sticas geogrÃ¡ficas y topogrÃ¡ficas, velocidades de los  servidores de los sitios web que usted visite, acciones de terceros etc.),  pueden dar por resultado conexiones interrumpidas y bloqueadas, velocidades de  servicio mÃ¡s lentas u otros efectos que disminuyan la calidad del servicio.</strong> <strong>Los servicios que dependen de la informaciÃ³n de la ubicaciÃ³n, como E911 y la  navegaciÃ³n GPS, dependen de la capacidad de su dispositivo para recibir seÃ±ales  de satÃ©lite (no disponibles normalmente en el interior de edificios) y de la  cobertura de la red.</strong> Mientras su Dispositivo se encuentre recibiendo una actualizaciÃ³n de software, podrÃ­a serle imposible usar su Dispositivo de cualquier forma hasta que la actualizaciÃ³n de software haya concluido.</p>
            <p><strong>Roaming</strong> </p>
            <p>El tÃ©rmino â€œ<em>roaming</em>â€� comÃºnmente se refiere a la cobertura en la red de otro proveedor, que pudiÃ©ramos poner a disposiciÃ³n de usted, dependiendo de nuestros acuerdos con otros proveedores. Estos acuerdos pueden cambiar de vez en cuando y la cobertura del <em>roaming</em> estÃ¡ sujeta a cambio sin previo aviso. La capacidad de usted para recibir cobertura de <em>roaming </em>depende de las transmisiones de radio que pueda captar su Dispositivo y la disponibilidad de cobertura de <em>roaming</em>. No extendemos ninguna garantÃ­a de que la cobertura de <em>roaming</em> estarÃ¡ disponible. La cobertura de <em>roaming</em> podrÃ­a existir tanto dentro como fuera de nuestras Ã¡reas de cobertura. Su Dispositivo generalmente indicarÃ¡ cuando estÃ¡ en <em>roaming</em>. Dependiendo de sus servicios, es posible que se apliquen cargos o lÃ­mites por separado en la cantidad de minutos usados mientras usted estÃ¡ en <em>roaming</em>. Determinados servicios podrÃ­an no estar disponibles o no funcionar de la misma manera durante la cobertura de <em>roaming</em> (por ejemplo, los servicios de datos, correo de voz, llamada en espera, etc.). Para informarse si se aplica el <em>roaming, </em>consulte la informaciÃ³n detallada de su plan de servicio. </p>
            <p><strong>Acerca de los servicios de datos y el contenido  de datos</strong></p>
            <p>Nuestros servicios de datos y su Dispositivo podrÃ­an permitirle el acceso a Internet, texto, fotos, video, juegos, grÃ¡ficos, mÃºsica, email, aplicaciones, sonido y otros materiales ("Contenido de datos") o el envÃ­o de Contenido de datos a otros dispositivos. Nosotros o nuestros proveedores ponemos a su disposiciÃ³n cierto contenido de datos, mientras que puede acceder a otros contenidos de datos de terceros (por ejemplo, pÃ¡ginas de Internet de terceros, juegos, tonos, aplicaciones, etc.). No proporcionamos absolutamente ninguna garantÃ­a respecto del Contenido de datos al que puede acceder con su Dispositivo. <strong>El contenido  de datos podrÃ­a ser:</strong> <strong>(1) inadecuado para niÃ±os/adolescentes; (2) no  fiable o impreciso, o (3) ofensivo, indecente u objetable.</strong> <strong>Usted es el  Ãºnico responsable de evaluar el Contenido de datos al que usted o cualquier  persona&nbsp; tiene acceso a travÃ©s de sus  servicios.</strong> <strong>Le recomendamos enfÃ¡ticamente vigilar el uso de datos por  niÃ±os/menores de edad.</strong> El Contenido de datos proveniente de terceros tambiÃ©n puede daÃ±ar su Dispositivo o su software. No somos responsables por ningÃºn contenido de datos. No somos responsables por ningÃºn daÃ±o causado por ningÃºn Contenido de datos al que usted acceda a travÃ©s de sus servicios, cargue en el dispositivo, o respecto al que solicite que nuestros representantes accedan o carguen en su dispositivo. Para proteger nuestras redes y servicios, o por otras razones, podrÃ­amos imponer restricciones al acceso a determinado Contenido de datos (como ciertos sitios web, aplicaciones, etc.), imponer cargos separados, limitar el procesamiento o la cantidad de datos que puede transferir, o de alguna otra manera limitar o dar por terminados los servicios. Si le proporcionamos espacio de almacenamiento para Contenido de datos que ha adquirido, podrÃ­amos eliminar el Contenido de datos con previo aviso o imponer restricciones/lÃ­mites al uso de las Ã¡reas de almacenamiento. El Contenido de datos almacenado en su Dispositivo/Dispositivo, transmitido a travÃ©s de nuestras redes, o almacenado por Sprint Prepaid podrÃ­a ser borrado, modificado o daÃ±ado. PodrÃ­a resultarle imposible hacer o recibir llamadas de voz mientras usa los servicios de datos. El Contenido de datos proporcionado por nuestros proveedores o terceros estÃ¡ sujeto a ser cancelado o a ser dado por terminado en cualquier momento sin previo aviso a usted, y usted podrÃ­a no recibir el reembolso de ninguna porciÃ³n del Contenido de datos que no haya utilizado del Contenido de datos.</p>
            <p><strong>TÃ©rminos y restricciones especÃ­ficas al uso de servicios de datos</strong>&nbsp; </p>
            <p>AdemÃ¡s de las reglas de uso de todos nuestros demÃ¡s servicios, a menos que identifiquemos el Servicio o Dispositivo que ha seleccionado como diseÃ±ado especÃ­ficamente para tal propÃ³sito (por ejemplo, retransmisores inalÃ¡mbricos, Data Link, etc.), no puede usar nuestros servicios de datos:&nbsp; (1) con dispositivos de servidor o aplicaciones de computadoras anfitriÃ³n, ni con otros sistemas que transmitan sesiones de datos o trÃ¡fico intenso de manera continua, y (2) como sustituto o respaldo de lÃ­neas privadas o conexiones de retransmisiÃ³n de tramas; o (3) para cualquier otro uso no intencional tal como lo determinemos a discreciÃ³n exclusiva nuestra. Nos reservamos el derecho de limitar, suspender o restringir cualquier uso de datos continuo o intenso que tenga impacto adverso en el funcionamiento de nuestras redes o que obstaculice el acceso a nuestras redes. Si sus servicios incluyen acceso a Internet o a datos, tampoco puede usar su Dispositivo como mÃ³dem de computadoras u otro equipo, a menos que identifiquemos el Servicio o Dispositivo que ha seleccionado como diseÃ±ado especÃ­ficamente para tal propÃ³sito (por ejemplo, con los planes de "telÃ©fono como mÃ³dem", planes de tarjeta de banda ancha mÃ³vil, planes de retransmisor inalÃ¡mbrico, etc.).</p>
            <p><strong>Licencia de software</strong></p>
            <p>Si Sprint Prepaid le proporciona el software como parte del servicio y no hay tÃ©rminos de la licencia de software suministrados con el software (por Sprint Prepaid o por un tercero), entonces Sprint Prepaid le otorgarÃ¡ una licencia limitada, revocable, no exclusiva, no transferible para utilizar el software a fin de acceder a los servicios para su propio uso individual. Usted no deberÃ¡ vender, revender, transferir, copiar, traducir, publicar, crear trabajos derivados del software, ni hacer ningÃºn uso comercial de este, ni modificar, realizar ingenierÃ­a inversa, descompilar o desensamblar el software. Sprint Prepaid puede revocar esta licencia en cualquier momento.</p>
            <p><strong>Cargos, activaciÃ³n y cargos diversos</strong></p>
            <p>En base a nuestras PolÃ­ticas, podrÃ­amos cobrar por activaciÃ³n, prepago, reactivaciÃ³n, programaciÃ³n u otros cargos para establecer, cambiar o mantener servicios. Determinadas transacciones tambiÃ©n podrÃ­an estar sujetas a un cargo (por ejemplo, pago de conveniencia, cambio de nÃºmeros telefÃ³nicos, actualizaciones del equipo, etc.). Se le <strong>informarÃ¡</strong> de este tipo de cargos antes de concluir la transacciÃ³n solicitada. </p>
            <p><strong>Cargos por uso</strong></p>
            <p>Los tipos de cargos en los que usted incurrirÃ¡ variarÃ¡n dependiendo del servicio utilizado y su plan de servicio. <strong>Usted es responsable de los servicios de su  cuenta y cargos asociados, incluidos los cargos hechos por una persona a la que  usted le permite tener acceso directo o indirecto a su dispositivo incluso si  usted no autorizÃ³ el uso de este.</strong> Los cargos pueden incluir, sin limitarse a ello, el prepago de los cargos de servicio; cargos por servicios adicionales; y los impuestos, recargos y cargos asociados con sus servicios. En cuanto a los cargos de uso real aplicables a su servicio, consulte el plan detallado u otra informaciÃ³n que le proporcionamos o a la que lo remitimos durante la transacciÃ³n de ventas o en nuestro sitio en Internet. Dependiendo de los servicios que usted tenga, los cargos por concepto de servicios adicionales podrÃ­an incluir asistencia telefÃ³nica o de la operadora, correo de voz, transferencia de llamadas, llamadas de datos, mensajes de texto, servicios internacionales, minutos de voz adicionales, servicios Premium&nbsp; (identificado en el momento de la activaciÃ³n del servicio) y acceso a lnternet. &nbsp;Si usted (el titular de la cuenta) permite que usuarios finales accedan a o usen su Dispositivo, usted autoriza a usuarios finales a acceder, descargar y utilizar los servicios. Generalmente se le cargarÃ¡ el uso de los servicios antes, o en, el momento del uso de conformidad con su plan de servicios. En algunos casos, podrÃ­amos aplicarle el cargo en algÃºn momento despuÃ©s de que usted utilice el servicio. Las tarifas que varÃ­an segÃºn la hora de acceso serÃ¡n determinadas basÃ¡ndose en la ubicaciÃ³n del equipo de la red que proporcione el servicio y no en la ubicaciÃ³n de su Dispositivo ni del cÃ³digo de Ã¡rea de su Dispositivo (de aplicarse). Los cargos generalmente se deducen del saldo de su cuenta (por ejemplo, cargos de pago-por-uso, cargos de suscripciÃ³n, etc.), aunque en algunos casos usted puede pagar por determinados servicios a travÃ©s de una tarjeta de crÃ©dito, tarjeta de dÃ©bito, u otro mÃ©todo de pago. Si ha incurrido en cargos que no fueron realizados antes de que el saldo de su cuenta llegara a un saldo de cero, podemos deducir estos cargos pendientes de pago,&nbsp; y los cargos de cualquier cantidad posterior que usted agregue al saldo de su cuenta. </p>
            <p><strong>Tipos de cargos</strong></p>
            <p>Generalmente evaluamos los siguientes tipos de cargos: (1) â€œcargos de pago-por-uso,â€� que son cargos cobrados cada vez que se utiliza el servicio, (2) â€œcargos de suscripciÃ³n,â€� â€“ los cuales son cargos que le permiten acceder a un servicio o proporcionarle una determinada cantidad de uso de un servicio durante un periodo definido de tiempo. Los cargos de suscripciÃ³n de los servicios terminan a las 11:59 p.m., en la zona horaria en la que se basa su nÃºmero de telÃ©fono, el Ãºltimo dÃ­a de su periodo de suscripciÃ³n. Asimismo, dependiendo de su servicio, algunos tipos de cargos de suscripciÃ³n podrÃ­an ser aplicados automÃ¡ticamente al efectuar la activaciÃ³n y ser aplicados automÃ¡ticamente en los periodos de suscripciÃ³n subsiguientes y (3) Â«cargos por descargar," que son cargos aplicados al descargar o acceder a contenidos, que recolectamos a nombre de nosotros o de proveedores de contenido externos. <strong> </strong></p>
            <p><strong>Â¿CÃ³mo calculamos sus Cargos?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Llamadas  de voz regulares:</strong> Los minutos parciales de uso se redondean al siguiente minuto completo. El tiempo empieza a contar cuando usted oprime â€œTalkâ€� (â€œhablarâ€�) o su Dispositivo se conecta a la red y termina cuando oprime â€œEndâ€� (â€œterminarâ€�) o se interrumpe la conexiÃ³n de la red de alguna otra forma. Se cobran al cliente todas las llamadas que conectan, incluso con contestadoras telefÃ³nicas, correo de voz o servicios de transcripciÃ³n de voz. No se cobra por llamadas no contestadas o si se escucha una seÃ±al de ocupado. En el caso de las llamadas entrantes que se contestan, se le carga a usted un poco antes de que el Dispositivo empiece a sonar hasta que usted oprime â€œEndâ€� o se interrumpe la conexiÃ³n de la red de alguna otra forma. Se le carga por toda la llamada en base a la tarifa que se aplica al perÃ­odo de tiempo en el que se inicia la llamada. Sin embargo, los tipos de cargos deducidos de su saldo varÃ­an dependiendo de su servicio. Los datos de hora de llamada que aparecen en su dispositivo pueden ser inexactos y podrÃ­an no ser confiables para la determinaciÃ³n de los cargos de su cuenta. El tiempo de llamada de una llamada individual podrÃ­a estar sujeto a una duraciÃ³n mÃ¡xima y la llamada podrÃ­a ser interrumpida automÃ¡ticamente si se excede la duraciÃ³n mÃ¡xima. </p>
            <p><strong>Uso de  datos:</strong> Dependiendo de su servicio, se le podrÃ­a cobrar por el uso de datos. Salvo que se le especifique de otra manera, el uso de datos se mide en bytes, kilobytes, megabytes y gigabytes, no en minutos/tiempo. 1024 bytes equivalen a un kilobyte ("KB"), 1024 KB equivalen a 1 megabyte, y 1024 megabytes equivalen a 1 gigabyte. Los bytes se redondean al kilobyte inmediato superior, de modo que se le cargarÃ¡ por lo menos 1 KB por cada sesiÃ³n de uso de datos ("sesiÃ³n de datos"). El redondeo ocurre al final de cada sesiÃ³n de datos, y a veces, durante una sesiÃ³n de datos. Dependiendo de sus servicios de datos, el uso podrÃ­a cargarse contra una provisiÃ³n o a un precio fijo por KB, y podrÃ­a estar sujeto a limitaciones sobre la cantidad del uso de datos. Si se le carga a un precio fijo por KB, cualquier fracciÃ³n de centavo se redondearÃ¡ al centavo inmediato superior. Se le cobran todos los datos dirigidos a la direcciÃ³n de Internet de su Dispositivo, incluidas las sesiones de datos que usted no iniciÃ³ y las transferencias incompletas. Siempre que su Dispositivo estÃ© conectado a nuestras redes de datos, usted podrÃ­a incurrir en cargos de datos. Los ejemplos de datos por los cuales se le harÃ¡n cargos incluyen el tamaÃ±o de un archivo o Contenido de datos (juego, tono, etc.) solicitado, grÃ¡ficas de pÃ¡ginas web (logotipos, fotos, banners, publicidad, etc.), datos adicionales usados para el acceso, transporte y enrutamiento del archivo en nuestra red, datos de descargas parciales o interrumpidas, datos reenviados y datos relacionados con intentos fracasados de acceder a sitios en Internet o usar aplicaciones. Estos cargos de datos son adicionales a cualesquiera cargos por el Contenido de datos en sÃ­ (juego, tono, etc.). Los datos usados y cargados a usted variarÃ¡n ampliamente, inclusive entre sesiones de datos o acciones idÃ©nticas. El estimado de uso de datos - por ejemplo, el tamaÃ±o de archivos descargables - no predice confiablemente el uso real. </p>
            <p><strong>Impuestos y cargos gubernamentales</strong><strong> </strong></p>
            <p>Usted acepta pagar todos los impuestos, cargos y otros gravÃ¡menes federales, estatales y municipales que por ley estemos obligados a cobrarle y remitir al gobierno por los servicios que le brindamos a usted. Estos cargos pueden cambiar de vez en cuando y sin previo aviso. </p>
            <p><strong>Recargos</strong></p>
            <p>Usted&nbsp; estÃ¡ de acuerdo en pagar todos los recargos de Sprint Prepaid (â€œRecargosâ€�), que podrÃ­an incluir, pero no estÃ¡n limitados a: Servicio Federal Universal, cargos Reglamentarios y Administrativos, cargos por ganancias brutas y otros cargos. <strong>Los recargos no son impuestos, y no es necesario  imponerlos por ley.</strong> <strong>Son parte de las tarifas que nosotros decidimos, a  discreciÃ³n exclusiva nuestra, cobrarle a usted con el fin de recuperar algunos  costos y que nosotros conservamos.</strong> <strong>El nÃºmero y el tipo de Recargos serÃ¡n  proporcionados y pueden variar dependiendo del lugar de la transacciÃ³n o de la  direcciÃ³n de la cuenta primaria del mÃ©todo de pago o Dispositivo y pueden  cambiar con el tiempo.</strong> <strong>Determinamos la cantidad de dichos cargos y las  cantidades estÃ¡n sujetas a cambio, asÃ­ como los componentes usados para  calcular dichas cantidades.</strong> Notificaremos al cliente acerca de cualesquiera cambios a los Recargos en una forma consistente con este Acuerdo (ver la secciÃ³n â€œNotificar a Ambas Partes como parte de este Acuerdoâ€�). Sin embargo, dado que algunos Recargos se basan en cantidades establecidas por el gobierno o en fÃ³rmulas gubernamentales, no siempre serÃ¡ posible dar una notificaciÃ³n previa acerca de nuevos Recargos o cambios en la cantidad de Recargos existentes. La informaciÃ³n acerca de Recargos se proporciona al momento de la transacciÃ³n de ventas y estÃ¡ disponible en nuestro sitio de Internet.</p>
            <p><strong>Cargos en disputa</strong></p>
            <p>Cualquier disputa a un cargo que aplicamos debe hacerla en los 60 dÃ­as siguientes a la fecha en que deducimos el cargo del saldo de su cuenta. Usted acepta todos los cargos no disputados correctamente dentro del perÃ­odo arriba mencionado. </p>
            <p><strong>Acerca de los saldos de su cuenta:</strong> <strong></strong>
              <br> Para mantener activa su cuenta y evitar la interrupciÃ³n del servicio, deberÃ¡ mantener un saldo a favor en su cuenta en todo momento o pagar los cargos de suscripciÃ³n aplicables, dependiendo de su plan de servicio. Los saldos de su cuenta no son transferibles, o canjeables por dinero en efectivo o reembolsables. Los cargos se deducen del saldo de su cuenta o usted podrÃ­a pagar determinados servicios con tarjeta de crÃ©dito, tarjeta de dÃ©bito o, de estar disponible, cuenta de Paypal (una "forma de pago registrada").Puede haber lÃ­mites en la administraciÃ³n de su cuenta, por ejemplo el saldo de la cuenta, cambio de nÃºmero y cambios del dispositivo.&nbsp; Consulte el plan detallado u otra informaciÃ³n que proporcionamos o a la que le remitimos durante la transacciÃ³n de ventas (tambiÃ©n disponible en sprint.com/prepaid1) para informarse sobre las normas del status de la cuenta que se aplican a su servicio. </p>

            <p><strong>Aplicaciones  de terceros:</strong> Si usted usa una aplicaciÃ³n de un tercero, Ã©sta podrÃ­a tener acceso, recopilar, usar o divulgar su informaciÃ³n personal o solicitar a Sprint Prepaid que divulgue la informaciÃ³n (incluyendo informaciÃ³n acerca de la ubicaciÃ³n (cuando sea aplicable) al proveedor de la aplicaciÃ³n o a algÃºn otro tercero. Si usted accede, usa o autoriza las aplicaciones de terceros a travÃ©s de los servicios, usted estÃ¡ de acuerdo y autoriza a Sprint Prepaid para que proporcione informaciÃ³n relacionada con su uso de los servicios o la(s) aplicaciÃ³n(es).

            <p><strong>InformaciÃ³n  sobre los dispositivos:</strong> Su Dispositivo podrÃ­a contener informaciÃ³n confidencial o personal (por ejemplo, fotos, videos, contraseÃ±as o nÃºmeros de tarjetas de crÃ©dito almacenados). Sprint Prepaid no es responsable de ninguna informaciÃ³n de su Dispositivo, incluyendo informaciÃ³n confidencial o personal. Si es posible, usted debe eliminar o proteger cualquier informaciÃ³n confidencial o personal cuando su Dispositivo no estÃ© en su poder o fuera de su control, por ejemplo, cuando ceda, intercambie, devuelva o recicle su Dispositivo. Al presentar el Dispositivo ante nosotros, usted estÃ¡ de acuerdo en que nuestros empleados, contratistas o proveedores podrÃ­an tener acceso a toda la informaciÃ³n en su Dispositivo. Si usted intercambia, devuelve o recicla su Dispositivo a travÃ©s de nosotros, usted debe eliminar todos los datos de su Dispositivo antes de que nos lo entregue.</p>
            <p><strong>Servicios habilitados segÃºn la ubicaciÃ³n</strong></p>
            <p>Nuestras redes por lo general conocen la ubicaciÃ³n de su Dispositivo cuando estÃ¡ al aire libre y/o encendido. Mediante el uso de diversas tecnologÃ­as para ubicar su Dispositivo, podemos brindarle servicios de emergencia del 911 mejorados, asÃ­ como servicios opcionales que son habilitados segÃºn&nbsp; la ubicaciÃ³n y que le proporcionamos nosotros o un tercero. La cobertura de la red o los factores ambientales (como estructuras, edificios, clima, caracterÃ­sticas geogrÃ¡ficas, de paisaje y topogrÃ¡ficas) pueden tener un efecto significativo en la capacidad para lograr el acceso a la informaciÃ³n de ubicaciÃ³n de su Dispositivo y para el uso de servicios que son capacitados segÃºn la ubicaciÃ³n. <strong></strong></p>
            <p>Usted conviene en que cualquier usuario autorizado puede acceder, usar o autorizar las aplicaciones habilitadas segÃºn la ubicaciÃ³n de Sprint Prepaid o de terceros a travÃ©s de los servicios. Usted comprende que su uso de ese tipo de aplicaciones habilitadas segÃºn la ubicaciÃ³n estÃ¡ sujeto a los tÃ©rminos y condiciones de la aplicaciÃ³n, asÃ­ como tambiÃ©n a sus polÃ­ticas, incluida su polÃ­tica de privacidad. Si usted activa servicios habilitados segÃºn la ubicaciÃ³n en dispositivos utilizados por otros usuarios autorizados, usted conviene en informar al(los) usuario(s) autorizado(s) acerca de los tÃ©rminos de uso de las aplicaciones habilitadas segÃºn la ubicaciÃ³n y que el Dispositivo puede ser localizado. </p>
            <p><strong>Uso del 911 u otras llamadas  de emergencia</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Los funcionarios de seguridad pÃºblica  recomiendan que cuando haga llamadas al 911 u otras llamadas de emergencia  siempre estÃ© preparado para proporcionar informaciÃ³n de su ubicaciÃ³n.</strong> A diferencia de los telÃ©fonos fijos tradicionales, dependiendo de diversos factores (p.ej., si su Dispositivo estÃ¡ habilitado para GPS, dÃ³nde usted se localice, si los proveedores de servicios de emergencia locales han modernizado su equipo, etc.), los operadores del 911 podrÃ­an no tener su nÃºmero telefÃ³nico, su ubicaciÃ³n o la ubicaciÃ³n de su Dispositivo. En algunas circunstancias, una llamada de emergencia se podrÃ­a canalizar al despachador de patrullas de la policÃ­a estatal o a una ubicaciÃ³n alterna que establezcan los proveedores de servicios de emergencia locales. El servicio 911 mejorado ("E911"), donde estÃ¡ en operaciÃ³n por las autoridades de emergencia locales, usa tecnologÃ­a GPS para proporcionar la informaciÃ³n de ubicaciÃ³n. Sin embargo, incluso si estÃ¡ disponible, el E911 no siempre proporciona informaciÃ³n de ubicaciÃ³n precisa. Si su dispositivo estÃ¡ en interiores o por alguna otra razÃ³n no puede adquirir una seÃ±al satelital, podrÃ­a ser que no le localicen. Algunos Dispositivos tienen una caracterÃ­stica de seguridad que bloquea el uso del teclado despuÃ©s de marcar el 911; debe obedecer los mensajes de voz cuando interactÃºa con los proveedores de servicios de emergencia que utilizan sistemas de respuesta interactiva de voz para canalizar las llamadas.</p>
            <p><strong>Si pierde o le roban su  Dispositivo</strong> </p>
            <p>Si pierde o le roban su Dispositivo, llÃ¡menos inmediatamente de manera que podamos congelar su cuenta. Usted podrÃ­a ser responsable de cargos por uso previos a su notificaciÃ³n a nosotros de la supuesta pÃ©rdida o robo. Usted acepta cooperar si decidimos investigar el caso (proporcionar hechos, declaraciones juradas, etc.). Es posible que no acreditemos o reembolsemos ningÃºn saldo a su cuenta si decide dar por terminados los servicios como resultado de la pÃ©rdida o robo de su Dispositivo. Si no activa un nuevo dispositivo o nos notifica que ha encontrado el dispositivo dentro de 60 dÃ­as a partir de la fecha en que congelamos su cuenta, su cuenta serÃ¡ desactivada, podemos aplicar un cargo igual al saldo de su cuenta (el cual no es reembolsable) y, de aplicarse, usted perderÃ¡ su nÃºmero de telÃ©fono. </p>
            <p><strong>Renuncia a las garantÃ­as </strong></p>
            <p>A MENOS QUE QUEDE EXPRESAMENTE ESPECIFICADO POR ESCRITO, NO hacemos aseveraciÃ³n alguna ni garantÃ­as, expresas o implÃ­citas, incluyendo (en la medida en que lo permita la ley) cualesquiera garantÃ­as implÃ­citas de comerciabilidad, no contravenciÃ³n o adecuaciÃ³n para un propÃ³sito en particular, concerniente a sus servicios (incluyendo su Dispositivo Y EL SOFTWARE O APLICACIONES DE SU DISPOSITIVO).

              <p align="center"><strong>RESOLUCIÃ“N DE  DISPUTAS Y ARBITRAJE</strong></p>
              <p><strong>POR FAVOR LEA CUIDADOSAMENTE ESTA INFORMACIÃ“N  PUES AFECTA LOS DERECHOS DE LOS QUE DISPONE</strong></p>
              <p>En aquellos poco frecuentes casos en los que sus inquietudes no sean resueltas satisfactoriamente a travÃ©s de llamadas a nuestro departamento de atenciÃ³n al cliente, tanto usted como Sprint Prepaid convienen en intentar resolver esas disputas de buena fe despuÃ©s de proporcionar una notificaciÃ³n por escrito de la disputa de la manera estipulada a continuaciÃ³n. Si la disputa no es resuelta, usted y Sprint Prepaid convienen en que dicha disputa serÃ¡ resuelta a travÃ©s de un proceso de arbitraje individual obligatorio o tribunal de reclamaciones menores, en lugar de hacerlo en un tribunal de jurisdicciÃ³n general.</p>
              <p><strong>Arbitraje obligatorio y renuncia a las demandas  en grupo</strong></p>
              <p><strong>En lugar de presentar una demanda en un  tribunal, usted y Sprint Prepaid convienen en arbitrar todas las Disputas (tal  como estÃ¡n definidas mÃ¡s adelante) en base individual no representativa.</strong> <strong>Usted conviene en que, al firmar  este Acuerdo, usted y Sprint Prepaid renuncian al derecho de tener un juicio  con jurado o de participar en una demanda en grupo o acciÃ³n representativa.</strong> <strong>Este acuerdo de arbitrar tiene la intenciÃ³n de ser interpretado ampliamente.</strong></p>
              <p>En el proceso de arbitraje, no hay un juez ni un jurado. En lugar de ello, las Disputas son decididas por un Ã¡rbitro tercero neutral a travÃ©s de un proceso mÃ¡s informal que el de un tribunal. En el arbitraje, ocurre un descubrimiento limitado de informaciÃ³n y la decisiÃ³n del Ã¡rbitro estÃ¡ sujeta a un anÃ¡lisis limitado por parte de los tribunales. Sin embargo, al igual que ocurrirÃ­a en un tribunal, el Ã¡rbitro debe respetar los tÃ©rminos del Acuerdo y puede adjudicar daÃ±os y compensaciÃ³n, lo que incluye cualesquiera honorarios de abogados que autoricen las leyes.&nbsp; </p>
              <p>Las â€œDisputasâ€� incluirÃ¡n, sin limitarse a ello, cualesquiera reclamaciones o controversias entre ambas partes que estÃ©n relacionadas o surjan de cualquier otra manera de nuestros servicios o del Acuerdo, incluyendo, sin limitarse a ello, la cobertura, Dispositivos, servicios y prÃ¡cticas de facturaciÃ³n, polÃ­ticas, prÃ¡cticas contractuales (incluyendo su aplicabilidad), reclamaciones de servicio, confidencialidad o publicidad, aÃºn cuando la reclamaciÃ³n surja despuÃ©s de que los servicios se hayan dado por terminados. Las disputas tambiÃ©n incluyen, sin limitarse a ello, reclamaciones que: (a) usted o un usuario autorizado o no autorizado de los Servicios o Dispositivos presente en contra de nuestros empleados, agentes, afiliados u otros representantes; (b) usted presente en contra de un tercero, tal como un minorista o un fabricante de equipo, que estÃ©n basadas o relacionadas, o que surjan, de nuestros servicios o del Acuerdo de cualquier manera; o (c) que Sprint Prepaid presente en contra de usted. Las disputas tambiÃ©n incluyen, sin limitarse a ello, (i) reclamaciones relacionadas o que surjan de cualquier manera a partir de cualquier aspecto de la relaciÃ³n entre usted y Sprint Prepaid, sin importar si estÃ¡ basada en el contrato, actos ilÃ­citos, un estatuto, fraude, representaciÃ³n falsa o afirmaciones publicitarias o cualquier otra teorÃ­a legal; (ii) reclamaciones que surgieron antes de este Acuerdo o de un Acuerdo anterior con Sprint Prepaid; (iii) reclamaciones sujetas a juicios en curso en los que usted no es miembro de una parte o de clase de grupo; y/o (iv) reclamaciones que surjan despuÃ©s de la conclusiÃ³n de este Acuerdo.</p>
              <p><strong>NotificaciÃ³n de disputa y periodo de resoluciÃ³n  de disputas</strong></p>
              <p>Antes de iniciar un proceso de arbitraje o una reclamaciÃ³n de tribunal menor, tanto usted como Sprint Prepaid convienen en primero proporcionarle a la otra parte una notificaciÃ³n por escrito (â€œNotificaciÃ³n de Disputaâ€�), la cual debe contener: (a) una descripciÃ³n escrita del problema y los documentos pertinentes e informaciÃ³n de apoyo; y (b) una declaraciÃ³n del remedio solicitado. La notificaciÃ³n de disputa a Sprint Prepaid debe ser enviada a:&nbsp; <em>General Counsel;  Arbitration Office; 12502 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mailstop VARESA0202-2C682;  Reston, Virginia 20191</em>. Sprint Prepaid le proporcionarÃ¡ a usted una NotificaciÃ³n de disputa de conformidad con la secciÃ³n â€œNotificaciÃ³n a cada uno segÃºn el acuerdoâ€� de este Acuerdo. Sprint Prepaid asignarÃ¡ a un representante para que trabaje con usted a fin de intentar resolver su disputa a su satisfacciÃ³n. Tanto usted como Sprint Prepaid convienen en intentar resolver la Disputa antes de dar inicio al proceso de arbitraje o acciÃ³n de reclamaciones menores. Si no se llega a un acuerdo dentro del periodo de cuarenta y cinco (45) dÃ­as a partir de la recepciÃ³n de la NotificaciÃ³n de disputa, usted o Sprint Prepaid pueden dar inicio a un proceso de arbitraje o acciÃ³n de reclamaciones de tribunal menor. </p>
              <p><strong>TÃ©rminos, proceso, reglas y procedimientos del  arbitraje</strong></p>
              <p>(1) A menos que usted y Sprint Prepaid lo acuerden de otra manera, el arbitraje lo conducirÃ¡ un solo Ã¡rbitro neutral y tendrÃ¡ lugar en el condado de la Ãºltima direcciÃ³n de facturaciÃ³n del servicio. El arbitraje se regirÃ¡ por: (a) reglas en que convengamos mutuamente; o (b) las Reglas y Procedimientos Comprensivos de Arbitraje de JAMS (Las â€œReglas de JAMSâ€�), tal como sean modificadas por este acuerdo para realizar el arbitraje, incluyendo las reglas sobre la presentaciÃ³n, administraciÃ³n, descubrimiento y cargos del Ã¡rbitro. Las Reglas de JAMS estÃ¡n disponibles en su pÃ¡gina de Internet en jamsadr.com1. A pesar de cualquier Regla de JAMS que indique lo contrario o de cualquier otra disposiciÃ³n en las reglas de arbitraje que hayan sido elegidas, por acuerdo, para regir el proceso de arbitraje, ambas partes convienen en que todos los aspectos relacionados con la Disputa son delegados a la decisiÃ³n del Ã¡rbitro, excepto que sÃ³lo un tribunal (y no el Ã¡rbitro) decidirÃ¡ acerca de cualesquiera desacuerdos relacionados con el alcance y aplicabilidad de este acuerdo para arbitrar.</p>
              <p>(2) La Ley Federal de Arbitraje (FAA por sus siglas en inglÃ©s) se aplica a este Acuerdo y a la disposiciÃ³n de arbitraje. Ambas partes aceptamos que las disposiciones de la FAA, no las leyes estatales, rigen toda cuestiÃ³n de si una Disputa estÃ¡ sujeta a arbitraje o no. En la medida en que este acuerdo para arbitrar entre en conflicto con la PolÃ­tica de JAMS sobre Arbitrajes al Consumidor de Acuerdo con los EstÃ¡ndares MÃ­nimos de las ClÃ¡usulas Previas a la Disputa para la Equidad Procesal (los â€œEstÃ¡ndares MÃ­nimosâ€�), se aplicarÃ¡n los EstÃ¡ndares MÃ­nimos a ese respecto. No obstante, nada de lo incluido en este pÃ¡rrafo le exigirÃ¡ o permitirÃ¡ al cliente o a Sprint Prepaid arbitrar en base grupal, representativa o consolidada. </p>
              <p>(3) El Ã¡rbitro puede otorgar una reparaciÃ³n declaratoria o por decreto sÃ³lo a favor de la parte individual que solicite la reparaciÃ³n y sÃ³lo en la medida necesaria para suministrar la reparaciÃ³n respaldada por la reclamaciÃ³n individual de esa parte. <strong>USTED Y SPRINT  PREPAID CONVIENEN EN QUE CADA UNO PUEDE PRESENTAR RECLAMACIONES EN CONTRA DEL  OTRO SÃ“LO EN CAPACIDAD INDIVIDUAL, Y NO COMO MIEMBRO DE UN GRUPO EN UNA CLASE  PUTATIVA O PROCESO REPRESENTATIVO.</strong> Asimismo, a menos que tanto usted como Sprint Prepaid expresamente convengan en lo contrario, el Ã¡rbitro no podrÃ¡ consolidar las reclamaciones de mÃ¡s de una persona, y no podrÃ¡ presidir de otra manera en cualquier forma de proceso representativo o en grupo. Si cualquier porciÃ³n de esta disposiciÃ³n resultara no ser aplicable, entonces la totalidad de la disposiciÃ³n de arbitraje serÃ¡ nula.</p>
              <p>(4) Cada una de las partes es responsable de sufragar sus respectivos costos, incluyendo sus respectivos abogados, expertos y testigos. Sprint Prepaid pagarÃ¡ toda cuota de presentaciÃ³n o administraciÃ³n de casos asociada con el arbitraje, asÃ­ como las cuotas profesionales de los servicios del Ã¡rbitro. </p>
              <p>(5) La sentencia del Ã¡rbitro serÃ¡ una declaraciÃ³n por escrito de la disposiciÃ³n de cada reclamaciÃ³n y tambiÃ©n deberÃ¡ incluir una declaraciÃ³n concisa por escrito de los resultados y conclusiones esenciales que forman parte de la sentencia. La sentencia y compensaciÃ³n que decida el Ã¡rbitro son finales y de acatamiento obligatorio, con ciertas excepciones bajo la Ley Federal de Arbitraje (FAA), y el juicio sobre la sentencia se puede presentar en cualquier tribunal con jurisdicciÃ³n.</p>
              <p>(6) Como alternativa al arbitraje, podrÃ­amos resolver las Disputas en un tribunal de reclamaciones menores en el condado de su mÃ¡s reciente direcciÃ³n de facturaciÃ³n. Asimismo, este acuerdo de arbitraje no evita que usted presente su Disputa ante una agencia del gobierno federal, estatal o local. De permitirlo la ley, dichas agencias pueden solicitar una reparaciÃ³n contra Sprint Prepaid en su representaciÃ³n.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>No habrÃ¡ juicio con jurado ni acciÃ³n en grupo</strong></p>
            <p>Si por cualquier motivo una reclamaciÃ³n QUE SURJA O ESTÃ‰ RELACIONADA CON ESTE ACUERDO DE ALGUNA MANERA se procesa en un tribunal en lugar de a travÃ©s del arbitraje, SIN IMPORTAR SI LA RECLAMACIÃ“N ES UNA ACCIÃ“N CONTRA-RECLAMACIÃ“N O CUALQUIER OTRO PROCESO DEL TRIBUNAL, ambas partes CONVIENEN EN QUE AL GRADO EN QUE LO PERMITA LA LEY, NO HABRÃ� UN JUICIO CON JURADO NI ACCIÃ“N EN GRUPO Y AMBAS PARTES incondicionalmente (1) renuncian a todo derecho de tener un juicio con jurado y (2) renuncian a todo derecho de presentar disputas en base grupal, incluyendo UNIR la reclamaciÃ³n con la reclamaciÃ³n de cualquier otra persona o entidad o presentar una reclamaciÃ³n en una capacidad representativa a nombre de cualquier otra persona en cualquier otro proceso.&nbsp; </p>
            <p><strong>IndemnizaciÃ³n</strong></p>
            <p>Usted acepta indemnizar, defender y evitar que Sprint Prepaid y nuestras compaÃ±Ã­as subsidiarias, afiliadas, principales, vendedores, proveedores y otorgantes de licencias suframos daÃ±os por cualquier reclamaciÃ³n que resulte de sus acciones, lo que incluye, sin limitarse a ello, al uso del servicio y cualquier informaciÃ³n que usted entregue, publique, transmita o comunique por medio del servicio, no proporcionar avisos apropiados respecto de servicios habilitados segÃºn la ubicaciÃ³n (vea la secciÃ³n "Servicios habilitados segÃºn la ubicaciÃ³n la ubicaciÃ³n"), no proteger sus contraseÃ±as, su pregunta de respaldo a su pregunta compartida secreta u otra informaciÃ³n de la cuenta, o la violaciÃ³n de este Acuerdo, o cualquier polÃ­tica mencionada en este Acuerdo, cualquier ley o reglamento aplicables o los derechos de cualquier tercero. </p>
            <p><strong>Proporcionar avisos entre ambas partes de conformidad con el Acuerdo</strong>&nbsp; <strong> </strong></p>
            <p> Salvo cuando el Acuerdo estipule especÃ­ficamente lo contrario, usted nos debe hacer llegar un aviso por escrito por correo a SPP, NSSG SBU 1084 S. Laurel Rd., London, KY 40744. Le proporcionaremos un aviso por correspondencia a su Ãºltima direcciÃ³n conocida que tengamos en nuestros registros, &nbsp;a cualquier nÃºmero de fax o direcciÃ³n de email que nos haya proporcionado, mediante una llamada a su Dispositivo o a cualquier otro nÃºmero de telÃ©fono que nos haya proporcionado, con un mensaje de voz en su Dispositivo o a cualquier otro nÃºmero de telÃ©fono que nos haya proporcionado, o a travÃ©s de un mensaje de texto en su Dispositivo. </p>
            <p><strong>Otros tÃ©rminos importantes</strong></p>
            <p>De conformidad con las leyes federales o a menos que el Acuerdo disponga especÃ­ficamente lo contrario, este Acuerdo estarÃ¡ regido exclusivamente por las leyes del estado donde se ubique el cÃ³digo de Ã¡rea asignado a su Dispositivo, sin considerar los conflictos de las normas del derecho de dicho estado. Si cualquiera de las dos partes renuncia o no hace valer un requerimiento de este Acuerdo en una situaciÃ³n dada, no renunciamos a nuestro derecho a hacerlo valer mÃ¡s adelante. Salvo cuando el Acuerdo estipule especÃ­ficamente lo contrario, si cualquier parte del Acuerdo resulta invÃ¡lida o no se le pueda hacer valer, el resto de este Acuerdo mantiene su vigencia y efectos plenos. Este Acuerdo no es para el beneficio de ningÃºn tercero, excepto nuestras compaÃ±Ã­as corporativas principales, afiliadas, subsidiarias, agentes, y predecesores y sucesores de interÃ©s. Usted no puede ceder el Acuerdo ni ninguno de sus derechos u obligaciones expresadas por Ã©l, a menos que nosotros estemos de acuerdo con la cesiÃ³n. Nosotros sÃ­ podemos ceder el Acuerdo.

            <p><strong><u>TÃ‰RMINOS Y CONDICIONES  GENERALES Y ESPECÃ�FICOS DE PAGO; AUTORIZACIÃ“N DE CARGO RECURRENTE</u></strong><strong><u> </u></strong></p>
            <p><strong>TÃ©rminos y condiciones  de AutoPay</strong><strong> </strong></p>
            <p>Se aplican los siguientes tÃ©rminos y condiciones si estÃ¡ inscrito en AutoPay Mensual.
              <br>
              <br> Usted, el Cliente, autoriza de manera recurrente a Sprint Prepagado a efectuar automÃ¡ticamente un cargo a la tarjeta de dÃ©bito o de crÃ©dito, o a la cuenta de PayPal que usted especificÃ³ para cubrir los pagos pendientes en el nÃºmero de cuenta de Sprint Prepagado que usted especificÃ³ cuando se inscribiÃ³ en AutoPay. Estos cargos recurrentes, y todos los demÃ¡s cargos a su cuenta, no son reembolsables. </p>
            <p>Sprint Prepagado podrÃ­a suspender la tramitaciÃ³n de cargos recurrentes si a Sprint Prepagado le es imposible obtener los fondos de la tarjeta de dÃ©bito o de crÃ©dito, o de la cuenta de PayPal para realizar los pagos que usted ha autorizado debido a, entre otras circunstancias, falta de fondos o fondos no cobrados en la cuenta o a informaciÃ³n insuficiente o incorrecta que usted haya proporcionado. Si un pago es devuelto por cualquier motivo, usted no podrÃ¡ hacer uso de una tarjeta de dÃ©bito o de crÃ©dito ni de PayPal hasta que su cuenta estÃ© al corriente. De ser pertinente, Sprint Prepagado podrÃ­a emprender acciones de cobranza, incluyendo la aplicaciÃ³n de cargos por cheques devueltos en la medida permitida por la ley. Todos los cargos de ese tipo podrÃ¡n ser recolectados electrÃ³nicamente. PARA MANTENER ACTIVA SU CUENTA Y EVITAR LA INTERRUPCIÃ“N DEL SERVICIO, DEBERÃ� MANTENER UN SALDO A FAVOR EN SU CUENTA EN TODO MOMENTO O PAGAR LOS CARGOS DE SUSCRIPCIÃ“N APLICABLES, DEPENDIENDO DE SU PLAN DE SERVICIO. </p>
            <p>Sprint Prepagado le enviarÃ¡ una notificaciÃ³n mediante un mensaje de texto a su dispositivo de Sprint Prepagado o un email, si un email estÃ¡ disponible, 10 dÃ­as antes de aplicar cualquier cargo recurrente. Sprint Prepagado tambiÃ©n enviarÃ¡ una notificaciÃ³n 10 dÃ­as antes de aplicar cualquier cargo recurrente cuya cantidad varÃ­e del cargo recurrente anterior o de la cantidad que usted eligiÃ³ y autorizÃ³ al inscribirse en AutoPay; sin embargo, al inscribirse en AutoPay, usted eligiÃ³ recibir dicha notificaciÃ³n sÃ³lo cuando una transferencia difiera de la transferencia anterior por mÃ¡s de $10.00. </p>
            <p>Asimismo, usted comprende que esta autorizaciÃ³n para pagar el nÃºmero de cuenta de Sprint Prepagado que usted especificÃ³ cuando se inscribiÃ³ en AutoPay a travÃ©s de cargos o dÃ©bitos recurrentes es totalmente opcional y no es indispensable para obtener o mantener su cuenta de Sprint Prepagado.
              <br> Usted es responsable de proporcionarle a Sprint Prepagado informaciÃ³n correcta sobre la cuenta de pago si dicha informaciÃ³n cambia en el futuro. Usted comprende que puede marcar *2 o ingresar a su cuenta de Sprint Prepagado a travÃ©s de Internet en <a href="http://www.sprint.com/prepaid" target="_blank">www.sprint.com/prepaid</a> tres dÃ­as antes de la fecha programada de su cargo recurrente con el fin de actualizar o cancelar AutoPay. Sprint Prepagado no darÃ¡ inicio a ninguna transferencia o cargo futuro despuÃ©s de que usted haya cancelado AutoPay y Sprint Prepagado haya tenido un periodo de tiempo razonable para tramitar su solicitud. </p>
            <p><strong><u>Si usted estÃ¡ inscrito  en la opciÃ³n AutoPay Mensual, lo siguiente se aplica a usted:</u></strong><strong><u> </u></strong>
              <br> AutomÃ¡ticamente se le cargarÃ¡n a usted cualesquiera cargos mensuales recurrentes y opciones adicionales, ademÃ¡s de cualquier impuesto de ventas y local, cada mes en su fecha lÃ­mite de pago. Los cargos pueden variar cada mes dependiendo de la suscripciÃ³n al servicio que usted haya seleccionado. En cualquier momento puede verificar su fecha lÃ­mite de pago ingresando a su cuenta a travÃ©s de Internet. </p>
