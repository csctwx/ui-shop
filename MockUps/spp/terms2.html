				<strong>Prohibited Network Uses.</strong> 
				To ensure that the activities of some users do not impair the ability of our customers to have access to reliable services at reasonable costs, you may not use our services in a manner that is unlawful, infringes on intellectual property rights, adversely harms, unduly interferes or affect the ability of other people or systems to use either our wireless services or other parties' internet-based resources, and for any other reason that, in our sole discretion, harms our network. 
				Sprint Prepaid reserves the right, without notice or limitation, to terminate individual calls, offer a different service plan with no unlimited usage components, limit data throughput speeds or quantities, deny, terminate, end, modify, disconnect or suspend service, and/or decline to renew service, if in its sole discretion, Sprint Prepaid determines such action is necessary to protect its wireless networks and/or its customers' service experience from harm and/or degradation. 
				<strong>Examples of Prohibited Voice Services uses:</strong> Voice services are provided solely for live dialogue between, and initiated by, two individuals for personal use &amp; as otherwise described in this policy. 
				Voice services may not be used for, nor are they intended for, any other commercial purposes, including, but not limited to, conference calling, voice monitoring services, data transmissions, transmission of broadcasts, transmission of recorded material, interconnection to other networks, telemarketing, autodialed calls, other commercial voice uses, and other connections that do not consist of uninterrupted live dialogue between two individuals. 
				<strong>Examples of Prohibited Data Uses:</strong> Data services are provided solely for purposes of web browsing, picture/audio/video messaging, and similar data activities. 
				<strong>Data services may not be used:</strong> 
				(1) with server devices or host computer applications or other systems that drive continuous heavy traffic or data sessions, including, but not limited to, disproportionate web camera posts or broadcasts, automatic data feeds, automated machine-to-machine connections, and peer-to-peer (P2P) f¬ile-sharing applications broadcast to multiple servers or recipients such that they could enable "bots" or similar routines;

Once you have reached the $400 maximum cash balance threshold, you will no longer be allowed to add any further funds to your account. Account funds cannot be transferred between Sprint Prepaid accounts. Adding funds through Sprint Prepaid customer service may result in processing fees.</p>
			<p><strong>Payment Date &amp; Account Active Period Information:</strong> You will have 120 days after your last payment to add money to your account to prevent cancellation, loss of all funds comprising your cash balance and your telephone number.

Payments for plan services do not include separately priced services, including, but not limited to, international services, wireless entertainment &amp; downloads.</p>

Accounts must be current and not in suspended status for Advance Payment. You may only pay one monthly recurring charge in advance. You can cancel the Advance Payment up to an hour before your next monthly recurring charge is due. Advance Payment may not be available with all products, services and offers.

			</p>

			</p>
			<p><strong>Your Right To Change Services &amp; When Changes Are Effective</strong></p> 
			<p>
				The account holder can typically change Services upon request. 
				In some instances, changes may be conditioned on payment of certain charges. 
				The effective date of any changes will depend on our Policies, the old Services, and the requested Services.  
				We will not credit or refund any subscription or other charges as a result of a change in Services.  
				We may—but are not obligated to—provide you the opportunity to authorize someone else to make changes to your Services. 
				You are responsible for any changes to your Services made by a person you authorize, and those changes will be treated as modifications to this Agreement.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Restrictions On Using Services</strong></p> 
			<p>
				You can't use our Services: 
				(a) in a way that could cause damage or adversely affect any of our other customers or our reputation, networks, property, or Services; or 
				(b) in any way prohibited by the terms of our Services, the Agreement, or our Policies. 
				You cannot in any manner resell the Services to another party. 
				For additional restrictions on the use of our Services, see our Acceptable Use Policy and Visitors Agreement, which are available on our website, and the detailed plan or other information on Services that we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Your Device, Number, &amp; Email Address</strong></p>
			<p>
				We don't manufacture any Device that we might sell to you or that is associated with our Services, and we aren't responsible for any defects, acts, or omissions of the manufacturer. 
				The only warranties on your Device are the limited warranties given to you by the manufacturer directly or that we pass through. 
				Device performance may vary based on device specifications (for example, a device's software, memory, and storage), and device performance may impact access to all of our Services. 
				This Device is sold exclusively for use with our Service and in other coverage areas that we may make available to you. 
				As programmed, it will not accept wireless service from another carrier. 
				Except for any legal right you may have to port/transfer your phone number to another carrier, you have no—and cannot gain any (for example, through publication, use, etc.)—proprietary, ownership, or other rights to any phone number, identification number, email address, or other identifier that we assign to you, your Device, or your account. 
				We'll notify you if we decide to change or reassign them. 
			</p>
			<p><strong>Porting/Transferring Phone Numbers</strong></p>
			<p>
				We don't guarantee that number transfers to or from us will be successful. 
				If you authorize another carrier to transfer a number away from us, then that is considered a request by you to us to terminate all of the Services associated with that number. 
			</p>
			<p><strong>Coverage; Where Your Device Will Work; Service Speeds</strong></p>
			<p>
				Our coverage maps are available at our authorized retail locations or sprint.com/prepaidcoverage. 
				The specific network coverage you get will depend on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and Services you've chosen. 
				Our coverage maps provide high level estimates of our coverage areas when using Services outdoors under optimal conditions. 
				Coverage isn't available everywhere. Coverage and Service speeds are not guaranteed. Coverage is subject to change without notice. 
				Service speeds may depend on the Service purchased. Actual speeds will vary. Estimating wireless coverage, signal strength, and Service speed is not an exact science. 
				There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that—along with other factors both within and beyond our control (for example, network problems, network or Internet congestion, software, signal strength, your Device, structures, buildings, weather, geography, topography, server speeds of the websites you access, actions of third parties, etc.)—may result in dropped and blocked connections, slower Service speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of Service. 
				Services that rely on location information, such as E911 and GPS navigation, depend on your Device's ability to acquire satellite signals (typically not available indoors) and network coverage. 
				While your Device is receiving a software update, you may be unable to use your Device in any manner until the software update is complete.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Roaming </strong></p>
			<p>
				The term "roaming" typically refers to coverage on another carrier's network that we may make available to you based on our agreements with other carriers. 
				These agreements may change from time to time, and roaming coverage is subject to change without notice. 
				Your ability to receive roaming coverage depends on the radio transmissions your Device can pick up and the availability of roaming coverage. 
				We make no guarantee that roaming coverage will be available. Roaming coverage may exist both within and outside our network coverage areas. 
				Your Device will generally indicate when you're roaming.   
				Depending on your Services, separate charges or limits on the amount of minutes used while roaming may apply. 
				Certain Services may not be available or work the same when roaming (for example, data Services, voicemail, call waiting, etc.). 
				For information on whether roaming applies, see your service plan details. 
			</p>
			<p><strong>About Data Services &amp; Content</strong></p>
			<p>	
				Our data Services and your Device may allow you to access the Internet, text, pictures, video, games, graphics, music, email, applications, sound, and other materials ("Data Content") or send Data Content elsewhere. 
				Some Data Content is available from us or our vendors, while other Data Content can be accessed from others (for example, third party websites, games, ringers, applications, etc.). 
				We make absolutely no guarantees about the Data Content that you access on your Device. 
				Data Content may be: 
				(1) unsuitable for children/minors; 
				(2) unreliable or inaccurate; or 
				(3) offensive, indecent, or objectionable. 
				You're solely responsible for evaluating the Data Content accessed by you or anyone through your Services. 
				We strongly recommend that you monitor data usage by children/minors. 
				Data Content from third parties may also harm your Device or its software. 
				We are not responsible for any Data Content. 
				We are not responsible for any damage caused by any Data Content that you access through your Services, that you load on your Device, or that you request that our representatives access or load on your Device. 
				To protect our networks and Services or for other reasons, we may place restrictions on accessing certain Data Content (such as certain websites, applications, etc.); impose separate charges; limit throughput or the amount of data that you can transfer; or otherwise limit or terminate Services. 
				If we provide you storage for Data Content that you have purchased, then we may delete the Data Content without notice or place restrictions/limits on the use of storage areas. 
				Data Content stored on a Device, transmitted over our networks, or stored by Sprint Prepaid may be deleted, modified, or damaged. 
				You may not be able to make or receive voice calls while using data Services. 
				Data Content provided by our vendors or third parties is subject to cancellation or termination at any time without notice to you, and you may not receive a refund for any unused portion of the Data Content.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Specific Terms &amp; Restrictions On Using Data Services</strong></p>  
			<p>
				In addition to the rules for using all of our other Services, unless we identify the Service or Device that you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, wireless routers, Data Link, etc.), you can't use our data Services: 
				(1) with server devices or host computer applications, or other systems that drive continuous, heavy traffic or data sessions; 
				(2) as a substitute or backup for private lines or frame relay connections; or 
				(3) for any other unintended use as we determine in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to limit, suspend, or constrain any heavy, continuous data usage that adversely impacts our networks' performance or hinders access to our networks. If your Services include Web or data access, you also can't use your Device as a modem for computers or other equipment, unless we identify the Service or Device you have selected as specifically intended for that purpose (for example, with "phone as modem" plans, mobile broadband card plans, wireless router plans, etc.).
			</p>
			<p><strong>Software License</strong></p> 
			<p>
				If Sprint Prepaid provides you software as part of the Service and there are not software license terms provided with the software (by Sprint Prepaid or by a third party), then Sprint Prepaid grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the software to access the Services for your own individual use. 
				You will not sell, resell, transfer, copy, translate, publish, create derivative works of, make any commercial use of, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the software. Sprint Prepaid may revoke this license at any time.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Fees, Activation &amp; Miscellaneous Charges </strong></p>
			<p>
				Based on our Policies, we may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain Services. 
				Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, handset upgrades, etc.). 
				You will be informed of these types of fees before we complete the requested transaction. 
			</p>
			<p><strong>Usage Charges </strong></p>
			<p>
				The types of charges that you incur will vary depending on the Service used and your service plan. 
				You are responsible for the Services on your account and associated charges, including charges made by a person you permit to have direct or indirect access to your device even if you did not authorize its use. 
				Charges may include, but are not limited to, prepayment for service charges; charges for additional services; and taxes, surcharges, and fees associated with your Services. 
				For the actual usage charges applicable to your Service, see the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction or on our website. 
				Depending on your Services, charges for additional services may include operator and directory assistance, voicemail, call forwarding, data calls, texts, international Services, additional voice minutes, premium services (identified at the time of Service activation) and Web access. 
				If you (the account holder) allow end users to access or use your Device, you authorize end users to access, download, and use Services. 
				You will generally be charged for use of Services before or at the time of use in accordance with your service plan. 
				In certain instances, we may charge at some point after you use the Service. 
				Rates that vary based on the time of access will be determined based on the location of the network equipment providing service and not the location of your Device or your Device's area code (if applicable). 
				Charges are generally deducted from your account balance (for example, pay-per-use charges, subscription charges, etc.), though in some instances you may be able to pay for certain Services through a credit card, debit card, or other payment method. 
				If you have incurred charges or fees that were not charged prior to your account balance reaching a zero balance, we may deduct these outstanding, unpaid charges and fees from any subsequent amounts you add to your account balance. 
			</p>
			<p><strong>Types of Charges</strong></p>
			<p>
				We typically assess the following types of charges: 
				(1) "pay-per-use charges," which are charges assessed each time a Service is used;
				(2) "subscription charges," which are charges that allow you access to a Service or provide you a certain amount of use of a Service for a defined period of time. Subscription charges for Services end at 11:59 p.m., in the time zone in which your phone number is based, on the last day of your subscription period. Also, depending on your Service, certain types of subscription charges may be assessed automatically upon activation and automatically assessed for subsequent subscription periods; and
				(3) "download charges," which are charges assessed when you download or access content, which we collect on behalf of ourselves or third-party content providers.
			</p>
			<p><strong>How We Calculate Your Charges </strong></p>
			<p>
				<strong>Regular Voice Calls:</strong> 
				We round up partial minutes of use to the next full minute. 
				Time starts when you press "Talk" or your Device connects to the network and stops when you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. 
				You're charged for all calls that connect, even to answering machines, voicemail, or voice transcription services. 
				You won't be charged for unanswered calls or if you get a busy signal. 
				For incoming calls answered, you're charged from the time shortly before the Device starts ringing until you press "End" or the network connection otherwise breaks. 
				You're charged for the entire call based on the rate that applies to the time period in which the call starts. 
				However, the types of charges actually deducted from your account balance will vary depending on your Service. 
				Call time data displayed on your device may be inaccurate and may not be relied upon for determining charges to your account. 
				Call time for a single call may be subject to a maximum duration and may be automatically terminated if the maximum duration is exceeded.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Data Usage:</strong> 
				Depending on your Service, you may be charged for data usage. 
				Unless we specifically tell you otherwise, data usage is measured in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes—not in minutes/time. 
				1024 bytes equals 1 kilobyte ("KB"), 1024 KB equals 1 megabyte, and 1024 megabytes equals 1 gigabyte. 
				Bytes are rounded up to KB, so you will be charged at least 1 KB for each data usage session ("data session"). 
				Rounding occurs at the end of each data session and sometimes during a data session. 
				Depending on your data Services, usage may be charged against an allowance or on a fixed price per KB, and you may be subject to limitations on the amount of data usage. 
				If you are charged on a fixed price per KB, any fractional cents will be rounded up to the next cent. 
				You are charged for all data directed to your Device's Internet address, including data sessions you did not initiate and for incomplete transfers. 
				As long as your Device is connected to our data networks, you may incur data charges. 
				Examples of data for which you will be charged includes the size of a requested file or Data Content (game, ringer, etc.); 
				Web page graphics (logos, pictures, banners, advertisement, etc.); additional data used in accessing, transporting, and routing the file on our network; 
				data from partial or interrupted downloads; re-sent data; and data associated with unsuccessful attempts to reach websites or use applications. 
				These data charges are in addition to any charges for the Data Content itself (game, ringer, etc.). 
				Data used and charged to you will vary widely, even between identical actions or data sessions. 
				Estimates of data usage—for example, the size of downloadable files—are not reliable predictors of actual usage. 
			</p>
			<p><strong>Taxes &amp; Government Fees </strong></p>
			<p>You agree to pay all federal, state, and local taxes, fees, and other assessments that we're required by law to collect and remit to the government on the Services that we provide to you. These charges may change from time to time without advance notice. </p>
			<p><strong>Surcharges</strong></p>
			<p>
				You agree to pay all Sprint Prepaid surcharges ("Surcharges"), which may include, but are not limited to: 
				Federal Universal Service; Regulatory and administrative charges; gross receipts charges, and other charges. 
				Surcharges are not taxes, and we are not required by law to assess them. 
				They are part of our rates we choose, at our discretion, to collect from you to recover certain costs, and are kept by us. 
				The number and type of Surcharges will be provided and may vary depending upon the location of the transaction or the primary account address of the payment method or Device and can change over time. 
				We determine the amount for these charges, and these amounts are subject to change as are the components used to calculate these amounts. 
				We will provide you notice of any changes to Surcharges in a manner consistent with this Agreement (see "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section). 
				However, because some Surcharges are based on amounts set by the government or based on government formulas, it will not always be possible to provide advance notice of new Surcharges or changes in the amount of existing Surcharges. 
				Information on Surcharges is provided during the sales transaction and is available on our website.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Disputing Charges </strong></p>
			<p>Any dispute to a charge that we assess you must be made in writing within 60 days of the date we deduct the charge from your account balance. You accept all charges not properly disputed within the above time period. </p>
			<p><strong>About Account Balances </strong></p>
			<p>To keep your account active and avoid service interruption, you must either maintain a positive account balance at all times or pay any applicable subscription charges, depending on your service plan. Account balances are not transferable, redeemable for cash, or refundable. Charges are deducted from either your account balance or you may be able to pay for certain services with a credit card, debit card or, as available, Paypal account (a "registered payment method").There may be limits on your account administration, for example account balance, number change, and device changes. See the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction (also available at sprint.com/prepaid) for the account status rules that apply to your Service. </p>
			<p><strong>Establishing or Replenishing Account Balances</strong></p>
			<p>Information on how you can establish and maintain an account balance will be provided at activation and is also available at sprint.com/prepaid or through Sprint Prepaid Customer Care. The replenishment methods available to you will depend on the terms of your Services. A fee may apply to certain replenishment methods. Some service plans may provide for automatic account balance replenishment through, for example, automatic billing to a credit card or debit card or automatic debit from an eligible account with a financial institution. Payment through these methods may be subject to limitations, including, but not limited to, the number of times an account may be debited or charged in a particular time period; the amount that may be debited or charged from an account; or other limitations imposed by us or the financial institution that holds the account.</p>
			<p><strong>Switching between Service Plans:</strong> Unless otherwise provided in the detailed plan or other information we provide or refer you to during the sales transaction, you may switch current Sprint Prepaid service plans. When you switch service plans, you will not receive a refund of any portion of any previously paid service charges and you will lose all of your remaining unused minutes, messages, and data allotment. Some service plans are available only on certain phones. Check sprint.com/prepaid for details and options. Repeated switching is not permitted and may result in termination of service. </p>
			<p><strong>Refunds:</strong> We are not responsible for, nor do we refund, lost, stolen, misused, or damaged replenishment cards.  We do not accept returns of or provide refunds for replenishment cards. Please ask your retailer any questions regarding its return policy. Replenishment cards must be applied to your account within the time specified on the card. All replenishment card sales are final and non-refundable regardless of who uses or possesses your mobile phone or device after you purchase services, and regardless of whether the mobile phone or device is used with your consent or knowledge.</p>
			<p><strong>Protecting Our Networks &amp; Services </strong></p>
			<p>We can take any action to: (1) protect our networks, our rights and interests, or the rights of others; or (2) optimize or improve the overall use of our networks and Services. Some of these actions may interrupt or prevent legitimate communications and usage—for example, message filtering/blocking software to prevent spam or viruses; limiting throughput; limiting access to certain websites, applications or other Data Content; prohibitions on unintended uses (for example, use as a dedicated line or use as a monitoring service); etc. For additional information on what we do to protect our customers, networks, Services and equipment, see our Acceptable Use Policy and Visitors Agreement at our website. </p>
			<p><strong>Your Privacy </strong></p>
			<p>Our Privacy Policy is available at sprint.com/legal/privacy.html. This policy may change from time to time, so review it with regularity and care. </p>
			<p><strong>Call Monitoring:</strong> To ensure the quality of our Services and for other lawful purposes, we may monitor or record calls you make to us or we make to you (for example, your conversations with our customer service or sales departments).</p>
			<p><strong>Authentication and Contact:</strong> You (the account holder) must password protect your account information by establishing a personal identification number ("PIN"). You may also set a backup security question and answer in the event you forget your PIN. You agree to protect your PIN, passwords, and other account access credentials like your backup security question from loss or disclosure. You further agree that Sprint Prepaid may, in our sole discretion, treat any person who presents your credentials that we deem sufficient for account access as you or an authorized user on the account for disclosure of information or changes in Service. You agree that we may contact you for Service-related reasons through the contact information that you provide, through the Services or Devices to which you subscribe, or through other available means, including text message, email, fax, recorded message, mobile, residential or business phone, or mail. </p>
			<p><strong>CPNI:</strong> As we provide telecommunications products and Services to you (the account holder), we develop information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location, and destination of telecommunications products and Services you use, as well as some other information found on your bill ("CPNI"). Under federal law, you have the right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI. For example, we implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI, including authentication procedures when you contact us. </p>
			<p><strong>Third-Party Applications:</strong> If you use a third-party application, the application may access, collect, use, or disclose your personal information or require Sprint Prepaid to disclose your information—including location information (when applicable)—to the application provider or some other third party. If you access, use, or authorize third-party applications through the Services, you agree and authorize Sprint Prepaid to provide information related to your use of the Services or the application(s). You understand that your use of third-party applications is subject to the third party's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. Be sure that you have reviewed and are comfortable with the third party's policies before using its application on your device.</p>
			<p><strong>Information on Devices:</strong> Your Device may contain sensitive or personal information (for example, pictures, videos, passwords, or stored credit card numbers). Sprint Prepaid is not responsible for any information on your Device, including sensitive or personal information. If possible, you should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your Device is out of your possession or control, for example, when you relinquish, exchange, return, or recycle your Device. By submitting your Device to us, you agree that our employees, contractors, or vendors may access all of the information on your Device. If you exchange, return, or recycle your Device through us, you must remove all data from your Device before you submit your Device to us.</p>
			<p><strong>Location-Enabled Services </strong></p>
			<p>Our networks generally know the location of your Device when it is outdoors and/or turned on. By using various technologies to locate your Device, we can provide enhanced emergency 911 services and optional location-enabled services provided by us or a third party. Network coverage or environmental factors (such as structures, buildings, weather, geography, landscape, and topography) can significantly impact the ability to access your Device's location information and use of location-enabled services. </p>
			<p>You agree that any authorized user may access, use, or authorize Sprint Prepaid or third-party location-enabled applications through the Services. You understand that your use of such location-enabled applications is subject to the application's terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy. If you activate location-enabled services for devices used by other authorized users, you agree to inform the authorized user(s) of the terms of use for location-enabled applications and that the Device may be located. </p>
			<p><strong>911 Or Other Emergency Calls </strong></p>
			<p>
				Public safety officials advise that when making 911 or other emergency calls, you should always be prepared to provide your location information. 
				Unlike traditional wireline phones, depending on a number of factors (for example, whether your Device is GPS-enabled, where you are, whether local emergency service providers have upgraded their equipment, etc.), 
				911 operators may not know your phone number, your location, or the location of your Device. 
				In certain circumstances, an emergency call may be routed to a state patrol dispatcher or alternative location set by local emergency service providers. 
				Enhanced 911 service ("E911")—where enabled by local emergency authorities—uses GPS technology to provide location information. 
				Even when available, however, E911 does not always provide accurate location information. 
				If your Device is indoors or for some other reason cannot acquire a satellite signal, you may not be located. 
				Some Devices have a safety feature that prevents use of the keypad after dialing 911—you should follow voice prompts when interacting with emergency service providers employing interactive voice response systems to screen calls.
			</p>
			<p><strong>If Your Device Is Lost or Stolen</strong></p> 
			<p>Call us immediately if your Device is lost or stolen so we can freeze your account. You may be responsible for usage charges before you notify us of the alleged loss or theft. You agree to cooperate if we choose to investigate the matter (provide facts, sworn statements, etc.). We may not credit or refund any account balance if you choose to terminate Services as a result of loss or theft of your Device. If you do not either activate a new device or notify us that you have found your device within 60 days from the date we froze your account, your account will be deactivated, we may assess a charge equal to the balance in your account (which is not refundable), and, if applicable, you will lose your phone number. </p>
			<p><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties </strong></p>	
			<p>UNLESS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN WRITING OTHERWISE, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE CONCERNING YOUR SERVICES (INCLUDING YOUR DEVICE AND ANY SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS ON YOUR DEVICE). WE DON'T PROMISE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICES AND DON'T AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO MAKE WARRANTIES ON OUR BEHALF. SPRINT PREPAID PROVIDES ALL SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITH ALL FAULTS, ERRORS, AND DEFECTS.</p>
			<p><strong>You Agree That We Are Not Responsible For Certain Problems </strong></p>
			<p>
				You agree that neither we nor our parent, subsidiary, or affiliate companies, nor our vendors, suppliers, or licensors are responsible for any damages, delay, interruption or other failure to perform resulting from: 
				(a) anything done or not done by someone else; 
				(b) providing or failing to provide Services, including, but not limited to, deficiencies or problems with a Device or network coverage (for example, dropped, blocked, interrupted Services, etc.); 
				(c) traffic or other accidents, or any health-related claims relating to our Services; 
				(d) Data Content or information accessed while using our Services; 
				(e) an interruption or failure in accessing or attempting to access emergency services from a Device, including through 911, Enhanced 911 or otherwise; 
				(f) interrupted, failed, or inaccurate location information services; 
				(g) information or communication that is blocked by a spam filter; 
				(h) damage to your Device or any computer or equipment connected to your Device, or damage to or loss of any information stored on your Device, computer, equipment, or Sprint Prepaid storage space from your use of the Services or from viruses, worms, or downloads of malicious content, materials, data, text, images, video, or audio; or (i) things beyond our control, including acts of God (for example, weather-related phenomena, fire, earthquake, hurricane, etc.), riot, strike, war, terrorism, or government orders or acts. 
				You should implement appropriate safeguards to secure your Device, computer, or equipment and to backup your information stored on each.
			</p>
			<p><strong>You Agree That Our Liability Is Limited - No Consequential Damages</strong></p>
			<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, OUR LIABILITY FOR MONETARY DAMAGES FOR ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US IS LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THE PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE SERVICE CHARGES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AFFECTED PERIOD. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO PROVIDING OR FAILING TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH A DEVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, OR COST OF REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. </p>
			<p><strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</strong></p>
			<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>
			<p>In those rare instances where your concern is not resolved to your satisfaction through calls to our customer care, you and Sprint Prepaid each agree to try to resolve those disputes in good faith after you provide written notice of the dispute as set forth below. If the dispute is not resolved, you and Sprint Prepaid agree that the dispute will be resolved through individual binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of courts of general jurisdiction.</p>
			<p><strong>Mandatory Arbitration and Waiver of Class Action</strong></p>
			<p>Instead of suing in court, you and Sprint Prepaid agree to arbitrate all Disputes (as defined below) on an individual, non-representative, basis. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Sprint Prepaid are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative action. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.</p>
			<p>In arbitration, there is no judge or jury. Instead Disputes are decided by a neutral third-party arbitrator in a more informal process than in court. In arbitration, there is limited discovery and the arbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts. However, just as a court would, the arbitrator must honor the terms of the Agreement and can award damages and relief, including any attorneys' fees authorized by law.</p>
			<p>
				"Disputes" shall include, but are not limited to, any claims or controversies against each other related in any way to or arising out of in any way our Services or the Agreement, 
				including, but not limited to, coverage, Devices, billing services and practices, policies, contract practices (including enforceability), service claims, privacy, or advertising, 
				even if the claim arises after Services have terminated. 
				Disputes also include, but are not limited to, claims that: 
				(a) you or an authorized or unauthorized user of the Services or Devices bring against our employees, agents, affiliates, or other representatives; 
				(b) you bring against a third party, such as a retailer or equipment manufacturer, that are based on, relate to, or arise out of in any way our Services or the Agreement; or 
				(c) that Sprint Prepaid brings against you. 
				Disputes also include, but are not limited to, 
				(i) claims in any way related to or arising out of any aspect of the relationship between you and Sprint Prepaid, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, advertising claims or any other legal theory; 
				(ii) claims that arose before this Agreement or out of a prior Agreement with Sprint Prepaid; 
				(iii) claims that are subject to on-going litigation where you are not a party or class member; and/or 
				(iv) claims that arise after the termination of this Agreement.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Dispute Notice and Dispute Resolution Period</strong></p>
			<p>
				Before initiating an arbitration or a small claims matter, you and Sprint Prepaid each agree to first provide to the other a written notice ("Notice of Dispute"), 
				which shall contain: 
				(a) a written description of the problem and relevant documents and supporting information; and 
				(b) a statement of the specific relief sought. 
				A Notice of Dispute to Sprint Prepaid should be sent to: General Counsel; Arbitration Office; 12502 Sunrise Valley Drive, Mailstop VARESA0202-2C682; Reston, Virginia 20191. 
				Sprint Prepaid will provide a Notice of Dispute to you in accordance with the "Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement" section of this Agreement. 
				Sprint Prepaid will assign a representative to work with you and try to resolve your Dispute to your satisfaction. 
				You and Sprint Prepaid agree to make attempts to resolve the Dispute prior to commencing an arbitration or small claims action. 
				If an agreement cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, you or Sprint Prepaid may commence an arbitration proceeding or small claims action.
			</p> 
			<p><strong>Arbitration Terms, Process, Rules and Procedures</strong></p>
			<p>(1) Unless you and Sprint Prepaid agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and will take place in the county of the last billing address of the Service. The arbitration will be governed by either: (a) rules that we mutually agree upon; or (b) the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (the "JAMS Rules"), as modified by this agreement to arbitrate, including the rules about the filing, administration, discovery and arbitrator fees. The JAMS rules are available on its website at jamsadr.com. Notwithstanding any JAMS Rule to the contrary or any other provision in arbitration rules chosen, by agreement, to govern the arbitration, we each agree that all issues regarding the Dispute are delegated to the arbitrator to decide, except that only a court (and not the arbitrator) shall decide any disagreements regarding the scope and enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate.</p>
			<p>(2) The Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") applies to this Agreement and arbitration provision. We each agree that the FAA's provisions—not state law—govern all questions of whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. To the extent that this agreement to arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness (the "Minimum Standards"), the Minimum Standards in that regard will apply. However, nothing in this paragraph will require or allow you or Sprint Prepaid to arbitrate on a class-wide, representative or consolidated basis. </p>
			<p>(3) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND SPRINT PREPAID AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PUTATIVE CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Sprint Prepaid expressly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If any portion of this provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
			<p>(4) We each are responsible for our respective costs, including our respective counsel, experts, and witnesses. Sprint Prepaid will pay for any filing or case management fees associated with the arbitration and the professional fees for the arbitrator's services. </p>
			<p>(5) An arbitrator's award will be a written statement of the disposition of each claim and will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions which form the basis of the award. The arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some limited court review under the FAA, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.</p>
			<p>(6) As an alternative to arbitration, we may resolve Disputes in small claims court in the county of your most recent billing address. In addition, this arbitration agreement does not prevent you from bringing your Dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agency. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against Sprint Prepaid on your behalf.</p>
			<p><strong>No Trial By Jury and No Class Actions</strong></p>
			<p>IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CLAIM IS AN ACTION, COUTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDING, WE EACH AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL OR CLASS ACTION AND WE EACH UNCONDITIONALLY (1) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND (2) WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CLASSWIDE BASIS, INCLUDING JOINING A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACTITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING.</p>
			<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
			<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Sprint Prepaid and our subsidiaries, affiliates, parent companies, vendors, suppliers, and licensors harmless from any claims arising out of or relating to your actions, including, but not limited to, your use of the Service and any information you submit, post, transmit, or make available via the Service; failing to provide appropriate notices regarding location-enabled services (see "Location-Enabled Services" section); failure to safeguard your passwords, backup question to your shared secret question, or other account information; or violating this Agreement or any policy referenced in this Agreement, any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party.</p>
			<p><strong>Providing Notice To Each Other Under The Agreement </strong></p>
			<p>Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, you must deliver written notice to us by mail to SPP, NSSG SBU 1084 S. Laurel Rd., London, KY 40744. We will provide you notice by correspondence to your last known address in our records, to any fax number or email address you've provided us, by calling you on your Device or any other phone number you've provided us, by voice message on your Device or any other phone number you've provided us, or by text message on your Device. </p>
			<p><strong>Other Important Terms</strong></p>
			<p>
				Subject to federal law or unless the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, this Agreement is governed solely by the laws of the state encompassing the area code assigned to your Device, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of that state. If either of us waives or doesn't enforce a requirement under this Agreement in an instance, we don't waive our right to later enforce that requirement. 
				Except as the Agreement specifically provides otherwise, if any part of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the rest of this Agreement remains in full force and effect. 
				This Agreement isn't for the benefit of any third party except our corporate parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, agents, and predecessors and successors in interest. 
				You can't assign the Agreement or any of your rights or duties under it unless we agree to the assignment. We can assign the Agreement without notice. 
				You cannot in any manner resell Devices or Services to another party. You cannot export any Device. 
				The Agreement and the documents it incorporates make up the entire agreement between us and replaces all prior written or spoken agreements—you can't rely on any contradictory documents or statements by sales or service representatives. The rights, obligations, and commitments in the Agreement that—by their nature—would logically continue beyond the termination of Services (for example, those relating to billing, payment, 911, dispute resolution, no class action, no jury trial) survive termination of Services.

			<p>Sprint Prepaid may discontinue processing  of recurring charges if Sprint Prepaid is unable to secure funds from the credit/debit  card or PayPal account for the payments you have authorized due to, but not  limited to, insufficient or uncollected funds in the account or insufficient or  inaccurate information you provided.
