                       <p>The following terms and conditions are specific to Auto Pay and are supplemental to (and do not supersede) the Virgin Mobile Custom® Service Agreement, which includes the Important Service/Product Specific and General Terms and Conditions of Service, that you received and accepted when you first became a Virgin Mobile Custom® customer. Your continued access to or use of the Auto Pay service after the receipt and review hereof constitutes your consent to the terms contained herein and your continued consent to the terms contained in the Service Agreement. You also continue to be bound by the terms of the Virgin Mobile Custom® Privacy Policy which details the conditions and circumstances under which, in the ordinary course of business, Virgin Mobile Custom® may provide information concerning you or your account to third parties. All of these terms and policy are available at <a href="http://www.virginmobileusa.com/legal/terms-and-conditions"><u>http://www.virginmobileusa.com/legal/terms-and-conditions</u></a></p>
                       <br />
                       <p>Through your enrollment in Auto Pay, which you hereby adopt as you electronic signature, you affirmatively consent and agree that Virgin Mobile Custom® can electronically provide to you all disclosures required by law and other information about your legal rights and duties related to the Auto Pay agreement you are entering into with Virgin Mobile Custom®.</p>
                       <br />
                       <p class="bold">General Payment Information</p>
                       <p>
By enrolling in Auto Pay, you authorize Virgin Mobile Custom® to, on a recurring basis, automatically charge the debit, credit card, or PayPal account you specify for payments due on the Virgin Mobile Custom® account number shown above. You also understand that this authorization to pay your Virgin Mobile Custom® account identified above by pre-authorizing recurring charges or debits to your debit card, credit card, or via Pay Pal is entirely optional and is not required to obtain or maintain your account with Virgin Mobile Custom®. </p>
<br />
<p>A valid major credit card, debit card or PayPal account (if available) (a "Registered Payment Method") must be registered and on file with Virgin Mobile Custom® at all times to take advantage of automatic payments. You understand that you are responsible for providing Virgin Mobile Custom® with accurate information about your Registered Payment Method and, if such information changes in the future, to provide updated information to Virgin Mobile Custom® at least prior to your scheduled payment. If a payment is returned for any reason, you will not be able to use your Registered Payment Method until your Virgin Mobile Custom® account is in good standing. You acknowledge and agree that if Virgin Mobile Custom® is unable to secure funds using your Registered Payment Method for any reason including, but not limited to, insufficient or uncollected funds in the account or insufficient or inaccurate information you provided, Virgin Mobile Custom® may discontinue processing of applicable recurring charges. You understand that all such fees may be collected electronically. If you need to change or update your Registered Payment Method, please either go to "Payment Options" via your Custom device, or access "My Account" via the web.</p>
<br />
<p class="bold">Billing; Notifications</p>
<p>
You will be automatically billed for the recurring payments which includes line fee(s), Base Plans (if any) and Special Offers (if any) until you affirmatively unenroll from the Auto Pay service in accordance with the section below entitled "Unenroll". These recurring charges and all other charges to your account are nonrefundable. Virgin Mobile Custom® will send an email indicating whether the attempt to charge your Registered Payment Method was successful and, if so, how much was charged and when the charge was made. These notifications will be your only notices of payment. You have the right to receive notice 10 days prior to any transfer that varies in amount from the previous transfer or from the amount you selected at the time of the Auto Pay enrollment; however, by enrolling in the Auto Pay service, you elect to receive such notice only when a transfer differs from the previous transfer by more than $10.00.</p>
<br />
<p class="bold">Billing Frequency and Amount; Payment Failure and Account Interruption</p>
<p>
Your first charge will occur on the date you selected this Payment Option and subsequent charges will occur automatically on each monthly anniversary date thereafter (assuming a successful first charge). If we are unable to charge your Registered Payment Method to make your monthly recurring payment, your service will be interrupted. You will be required to manually add enough funds to your account to have your service restored, and upon restoration, your monthly payment anniversary date will then be based upon your date of restoration if you pass your next scheduled payment date. You can manually add funds by accessing the "Payment Options" section on your device or on the web under "My Account".</p>

<p class="bold">Unenroll</p>
<p>
You understand that you may contact Virgin Mobile Custom® to request that recurring payments from your Registered Payment Method be modified or discontinued. To unenroll from the Auto Pay service, you must affirmatively unenroll either by accessing the "Payment Options" section on your device or on the web under "My Account". </p>
<br />
<p>Cancellation will become effective immediately. You understand that by unenrolling you will be terminating your Auto Pay service entirely. However, unenrolling will not delete the Registered Payment Method you have on file. Virgin Mobile Custom® will not initiate further transfers or charges after you have cancelled and Virgin Mobile Custom® has had a reasonable period of time to process your request. You also understand that you are not waiving your rights under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act to stop payments by directly contacting the institution responsible for your Registered Payment Method, and that your exercise of such rights does not constitute a breach of your authorization to enroll in Auto Pay.</p>

<p class="bold">Questions and Errors</p>
<p>
If you have questions about any electronic transfer, or if you believe there is an error regarding an automatic payment set forth in the email referred to in the section above entitled "Billing; Notifications", please call us as soon as possible or write us at <span class="bold">Attn: VMU / ASW NSSG SBU 1084 S. Laurel Rd. London, KY 40744.</span> You can also email us at <a href="mailto:ourteam@virginmobileusa.com"><u>ourteam@virginmobileusa.com</u></a>. You are not liable for unauthorized electronic transfers, or for Virgin Mobile Custom's® failure to properly make or stop certain transfers as required; however, we must hear from you regarding the suspected problem or error no later than 60 days after we send the applicable text message and/or email on which the problem or error appears. Your complaint or question should include the following information:</p>

<ul style="margin:25px">
    <li>(1) Your name and phone number;</li>
    <li>(2) A description of the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and a clear explanation of why you believe it is an error or why you need more information; and</li>
    <li>(3) The dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you tell us of your complaint or question over the phone, we may require that you follow up by sending us the relevant information in writing within 10 business days.</p>
<br />
<p>Within 10 business days after your call or our receipt of your written statement containing the information described above, we will attempt to determine whether an error has occurred and if it has, we will promptly correct the error. However, we may require up to 45 days to investigate the matter (90 days for new accounts or point-of-sale or foreign transactions), and if we do, we will temporarily credit the disputed amount to your account within 10 business days (20 business days for new accounts) so that you will have the use of the money or airtime during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account.</p>
