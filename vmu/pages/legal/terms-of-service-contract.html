Your agreement with Virgin Mobile USA, L.P. includes these Terms of Service and the terms of your Rate Plan. Please read these carefully.<br><br> The Terms of Service generally apply to the "Contract" phones we sell and services we offer to our customers, while the Rate Plan includes the rates, features and other terms for the monthly allowances for minutes, messages or data that you have agreed to purchase and to which you have subscribed. To the extent that these Terms of Service conflict with any term in your Rate Plan, these Terms of Service will govern.<br><br> Your agreement with Virgin Mobile, which includes these Terms of Service and the terms of your Rate Plan, becomes effective when you accept the terms of the agreement. You accept your agreement by doing any of the following: (1) purchasing or activating a Virgin Mobile phone; (2) giving us a written or electronic signature; (3) telling us orally that you accept; or (4) using your service after you make a change or addition.

										<h4 id="our_right_to_make_changes">Our Right to Make Changes</h4>
										<p>Our service is provided at our discretion. Your right to use our service is subject to our business policies, practices and procedures which we may change without providing notice to you. Unless expressly prohibited by law, we reserve the right to modify or cancel it or take corrective action at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, your violation of any provision of these Terms of Service or the terms of your Rate Plan. Check the Virgin Mobile website, www.virginmobileusa.com, for the most recent Terms of Service and Rate Plans. We will notify you if we make any change to these Terms of Service or the terms of your Rate Plan that are determined to be materially adverse to you 30 days in advance of such change. You can terminate service with us prior to the end of your Term without incurring any early termination fee if you notify us within sixty (60) days of receiving the notice of a materially adverse change in these Terms of Service or your Rate Plan. If you do not terminate your service within this sixty (60)-day period, you agree to accept any such changes.</p>

										<h4 id="service_commitment">Mobile Telecommunications Services</h4>
										<p>Virgin Mobile USA, L.P. provides telecommunications services using the Nationwide Sprint Network exclusively with Virgin Mobile phones and devices purchased from Virgin Mobile or an authorized retailer. You cannot use our service with any other mobile phone or device or on any other network, and you may not use your Virgin Mobile phone or device with any other service or network. Airtime may be used for domestic and international calling from the United States and for related services as provided in these Terms of Service or your Rate Plan. Virgin Mobile phones and mobile phone numbers may not be used for pager or voicemail-only service, and Virgin Mobile may terminate any account if usage is limited to pager service or voicemail retrieval service.<br><br> The Virgin Mobile service is for personal use only. You may not use our service in a manner that interferes with another Virgin Mobile customer's use of our service. We have determined that our ability to provide good service may be impaired when customers place abnormally high numbers of calls, send or receive unusually high numbers of messages, or repeatedly place calls of unusually long duration, relative to typical usage by other Virgin Mobile customers on similar service plans. Such atypical usage suggests that a mobile phone is being used other than for personal use in violation of these Terms of Service. Unlimited voice services are provided solely for live dialog between two individuals. Unlimited voice services may not be used for monitoring services, data transmissions, or other connections that do not consist of uninterrupted live dialog between two individuals.<br><br> You agree not to use Virgin Mobile services in any way that is illegal, fraudulent or abusive, as determined by Virgin Mobile in its sole discretion. You may not alter any of the hardware or software on your Virgin Mobile phone for any purpose. We may change your mobile phone's software, applications or programming remotely and without notice. This may affect stored data or other personal information or programming on your mobile phone for which we are not responsible. Virgin Mobile phones may not be purchased in bulk or sold to third parties.<br><br> The software and content on the Virgin Mobile phones and devices, including the operating system, applications, data, information, music, games, images, text and other material, are owned by Virgin Mobile and/or its business partners. You are permitted to use this software and content solely in connection with your use of the Virgin Mobile phone with our service as expressly authorized under these Terms of Service. You may not distribute or upload any pre-loaded software or content to another device or transmit or broadcast the software or content, or otherwise copy or use the software or content in any manner not expressly authorized under these Terms of Service or, with respect to any downloaded content or applications, any other governing terms of use. If you violate any material term of these Terms of Service, including without limitation by using a Virgin Mobile phone or device on another network without our prior written consent, by modifying any hardware or software on a Virgin Mobile phone or device, or by distributing, copying or otherwise using any of the software or content on a Virgin Mobile phone in a manner that is not authorized by these Terms of Service, your license to the software and content shall terminate immediately and your continued use will constitute copyright infringement.<br><br> Service is only available in geographic areas covered by the digital service network footprint of the Sprint Nationwide Network. Local phone numbers may not be available in certain Sprint and affiliate markets.<br><br> Wireless services use radio transmissions and are therefore affected by limitations. Coverage is not available everywhere. Quality of service may be affected by conditions within and beyond our control, including atmospheric, geographic, or topographic conditions, or by you damaging your mobile phone. We do not warrant or guarantee that service will be available at any specific time or geographic location, or that service will be provided without interruption. We may give credit for continuous service interruption of more than 24 hours on a case-by-case basis, if such interruption was reasonably within our control, and if you notify Virgin Mobile customer service at <span class="skype_c2c_print_container notranslate">1-888-884-3546</span><span id="skype_c2c_container" class="skype_c2c_container notranslate" dir="ltr" tabindex="-1" onmouseover="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.showMenu(this, event)" onmouseout="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.hideMenu(this, event)" onclick="SkypeClick2Call.MenuInjectionHandler.makeCall(this, event)" data-numbertocall="+18888843546" data-numbertype="tollfree" data-isfreecall="true" data-isrtl="false" data-ismobile="false"><span class="skype_c2c_highlighting_inactive_common" dir="ltr" skypeaction="skype_dropdown"><span class="skype_c2c_textarea_span" id="free_num_ui"><img width="0" height="0" class="skype_c2c_logo_img" src="chrome-extension://lifbcibllhkdhoafpjfnlhfpfgnpldfl/call_skype_logo.png"><span class="skype_c2c_text_span">1-888-884-3546</span><span class="skype_c2c_free_text_span"></span></span>
											</span>
											</span> within seven days of the interruption. Any statements or maps provided by us, our agents, or dealers about coverage are only intended to provide high-level estimates of our coverage areas when using our service outdoors under optimal conditions and do not mean that service will be available under all circumstances, at all times or without interruption. Estimating wireless coverage and signal strength is not an exact science. There are gaps in coverage within our estimated coverage areas that, along with other factors both within and beyond our control, may result in service interruptions, slower data speeds, or otherwise impact the quality of service. You should therefore never solely rely on your mobile phone for emergency calls, such as to 911.<br><br> Rates that vary based on the time of a call will be determined based on the location of the network equipment providing service for a particular call and not the location of your mobile phone or your mobile phone's area code. Airtime usage is measured from the time the network begins to process the call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through the network's termination of the call (after you hang up). Therefore, call time data displayed on your mobile phone may be inaccurate and may not be relied upon for billing purposes.</p>

									<div class="tos_block">
										<h4 id="term_termination">Term/Termination</h4>
										<p>A one (1) year minimum term ("Term") will apply to your account. You agree to maintain service with us for the minimum Term, unless we terminate your service earlier in accordance with these Terms of Service. After you have satisfied your Term, this agreement will automatically renew on a month-to-month basis until you or we terminate service. Periods of suspension do not count toward fulfillment of your Term. You are responsible for all fees and service charges incurred prior to the date of termination and will not be entitled to any credits or refunds. We will treat any attempt to "port," or take your phone number to another company, as your request to terminate service upon successful porting of your number. You remain responsible for any fees (including early termination fees) and service charges through the end of your current monthly billing cycle.</p>
									</div>

									<div class="tos_block">
										<h4 id="early_termination_fee">Early Termination Fee</h4>
										<p>If you cancel service during the Term, or if we terminate it prior to fulfillment of your Term for your violation of these Terms of Service or your Rate Plan or for any other reason, you will be liable for an early termination fee of up to $175 for each wireless number or other account terminated. The early termination fee applies only to the extent permitted by law and does not apply if you terminate service during the first thirty (30) days of your Term or within sixty (60) days of any change to these Terms of Service or the terms of your Rate Plan during your Term that are determined to be materially adverse to you. You agree that the addition of a tax or surcharge or an increase in any applicable tax or surcharge shall not be deemed to be a material adverse change. For new Terms or renewal Terms beginning on or after January 1, 2009, the early termination fee will be reduced by $5.00 for each full month paid toward your minimum Term that you complete based upon the date you cancel service. Payment of the early termination fee does not satisfy other outstanding obligations you may owe to us, such as equipment-related charges or charges for services already used but not yet billed at the time of cancellation.<br><br> The early termination fee is part of our rates and is payable at the end of your current billing cycle along with any outstanding charges for service.

									<div class="tos_block">
										<h4 id="international_roaming">International Roaming</h4>
										<p>If you use your Virgin Mobile phone while roaming in certain countries, international roaming, messaging, data, and usage charges will apply.</p>

											</span>. Virgin Mobile will bill you monthly for service and you agree to pay us in a timely fashion any amounts due for a mobile phone, service, taxes, surcharges, and any other related charges. Some billing may be delayed and your bill may reflect charges incurred before the current month. Charges for monthly service allotments and other charges are billed one month in advance, while charges for certain features, including directory assistance, text messaging, data services and Internet access, may be billed in arrears. You agree to pay all charges associated with your account, including all charges for products you accept or access that have an additional charge, including directory assistance calls ("411" or "0") and other premium services. Unless otherwise specified in your Rate Plan, unused monthly allotment of minutes from one monthly billing cycle do not carry over to the next monthly billing cycle.<br><br> We may elect to offer discounts or other benefits for certain accounts for additional lines of service billed on a single bill or accounts that may share minutes. We refer to these accounts as "Family Plan(s)". Data charges may apply to each line on a Family Plan as set forth in the applicable Rate Plan. We may determine, in our sole discretion, which line(s) will and will not be eligible for a discount and the amount of any discount, including when you change plans or add or remove upgrades and enhancements. A minimum Term, activation fee, early termination fee, taxes and fees, and other restrictions and conditions may apply to each additional line of a Family Plan. We may also place a maximum or minimum limit on the number of lines that may be placed on a Family Plan and may require an activation fee for each line of service activated on a Family Plan. We may place other restrictions or conditions on Family Plans. Additional terms, conditions and restrictions may be applicable to the activation and maintenance of a Family Plan.<br><br> Unless otherwise specified in your Rate Plan, if you use all of the anytime minutes associated with your plan before a new monthly billing cycle starts, you will be charged 35¢ for each additional anytime minute you use provided that you have a sufficient balance in your account. Night minutes must be used between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Monday-Friday, and weekend minutes must be used between 7:00 p.m. Friday and 7:00 a.m. Monday. Each minute of a call will be billed according to the time or date applicable to that minute. Calls are billed in one-minute increments, with a minimum time per call of one minute. Call times are rounded up to the nearest whole minute. International calls are billed at the international per-minute rate for the country you are calling plus your standard airtime rate. International rates vary.<br><br> Services that have both cash and minutes-denominated components, such as international long distance or 411 directory assistance, will be charged to you and deducted from anytime or night and weekend minutes.<br><br> Auto Bill Pay allows you to set up an automatic monthly payment for your Virgin Mobile account. You can choose to have your bill paid automatically each month from a credit card or debit card. Once you set up Auto Bill Pay, your monthly payment will automatically be charged to the payment method you selected 20 days after your bill cycle date.</p>

										<p>Payment is due in full on the date stated on your bill. If we do not receive payment in full by the due date, we may do one or more of the following: (1) to the extent permitted by law, charge you a late fee of up to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (18% annually), or a flat $5 fee per month, whichever is greater on unpaid balances; (2) charge you for any collection agency fees billed to us for trying to collect from you; (3) suspend your service (though monthly charges will continue to accrue until the account is canceled); (4) bill you a reasonable fee to reinstate a suspended account; and (5) terminate this agreement (and charge you an early termination fee if the agreement is terminated prior to the end of your Term).
											<br><br>If we bill you on behalf of your use of a third-party's service, we will apply any payments received from you first to charges you have incurred with us. We may use a collection agency, and you agree to pay any collection agency fees, if your account remains unpaid for a period of sixty (60) days from the due date on your bill. Our acceptance of late or partial payments does not constitute a waiver of our right to collect full and timely payment from you. We may assess a charge of up to $25, depending upon applicable law, for each check that is returned to us or dishonored, and may immediately suspend or terminate your service. We may require a deposit from you to initiate or maintain service with us. The amount of any deposit (and the length of time that we hold the deposit) may vary based on your credit history, your payment history and the Rate Plan that you select. You agree that we can apply any deposit to any amount that remains unpaid from you for a period of sixty (60) days after the due date on your bill. If we require a deposit, we will pay simple interest on the deposit if required, at the rate the applicable law (if any) calls for. Please retain your evidence of deposit. A refundable deposit will only be returned after at least twelve (12) consecutive payments are made in full and on time, or until service is terminated. If your service is terminated for any reason, we may keep and apply the deposit to any outstanding charges or fees that you owe to us first, including any early termination fee that may apply. You agree that we can apply deposits, payments, or prepayments in any order to any amounts you owe us on any account. We will send any remaining deposit to your last known address ninety (90) days after your service is terminated. You cannot use a deposit to pay any bill unless we agree to this method of payment. We refund final credit balances of less than $1 only upon request.<br><br> We may establish a credit limit on your account depending on your credit history, your payment history and the Rate Plan that you select. If your account balance exceeds the limit set for you, we may immediately suspend your service or features, even if your account is not past due, until the balance is brought below the limit that we have set.
