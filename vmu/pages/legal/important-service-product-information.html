									<p><strong>Terms of Service. These terms are subject to the Virgin Mobile General Terms and Conditions.</strong>Prices, offers and programs are subject to change without notice, may not be available with all devices or in all markets/retail locations, or combinable with other promotions/options. Activation of account will occur when sufficient funds are added. Service charges are not refunded or prorated if service is terminated or modified before your next payment date. Unused services, including, but not limited to, plan minutes, messages or data allotments, expire at the end of each plan cycle or when a customer switches service plans and do not carry forward. Partial minutes of use are rounded up to the next whole minute. Switching between Virgin Mobile service offerings may result in a new prepaid account. State, local sales taxes and fees may apply when adding funds to your account. </p>
									<p>Coverage not available everywhere and varies by service. Visit virginmobileusa.com/check-cell-phone-coverage for details. Our services will only work with our devices - not all services are available with all devices or on all networks. Virgin Mobile 4G devices are powered by the Sprint 4G (WiMAX) network. Unless otherwise noted, Virgin Mobile 4G devices will only work on the Sprint 4G (WiMAX) network, not the Sprint 4G LTE network. Not all services available on 4G and coverage may default to 3G/1xRTT where 4G is unavailable.</p>
									<p><strong>Nature of our Service.</strong> Our rate plans, customer devices, services and features are not for resale and are intended for reasonable and non-continuous use by a person using a device on the Sprint network. The primary use of your device must be for domestic purposes within the Sprint-owned network and for other purposes outlined in our offers. Domestic means use in the 48 contiguous states, Hawaii, DC, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Virgin Mobile may limit or terminate service if you move outside of the Sprint owned-network. </p>
									<p><strong>UNLIMITED DOES NOT MEAN UNREASONABLE USE.</strong> To ensure that all customers have access to reliable services provided at a reasonable cost, you may not use our service in a manner that interferes with another Virgin Mobile customer's use of our service or disproportionally impacts Virgin Mobile's network resources. Virgin Mobile reserves the right, without notice or limitation, to terminate individual calls, or after providing notice to you, offer you a different service plan with no unlimited usage components, limit data throughput speeds or quantities, or deny, terminate, end, modify, disconnect or suspend your service, or decline to renew your service, if you engage in any of the prohibited voice or data uses detailed below or if Virgin Mobile, in its sole discretion, determines action is necessary to protect its wireless networks from harm or degradation. <strong>Examples of Prohibited Voice Uses.</strong> Virgin Mobile voice services are provided solely for live dialogue between, and initiated by, two individuals for personal use &amp; as otherwise described in this policy. Virgin Mobile voice services may not be used for any other commercial purposes including, but not limited to, conference calling, monitoring services, data transmissions, transmission of broadcasts, transmission of recorded material, interconnection to other networks, telemarketing, autodialed calls, other commercial uses, or other connections that do not consist of uninterrupted live dialogue between two individuals. <strong>Examples of Prohibited Data Uses.</strong> Virgin Mobile data services are provided solely for purposes of web browsing, messaging, and similar data activities. You may not use the data service: (1) with server devices or host computer applications or other systems that drive continuous heavy traffic or data sessions, including, but not limited to, disproportionate web camera posts or broadcasts, automatic data feeds, automated machine-to-machine connections, peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing applications broadcast to multiple servers or recipients such that they could enable "bots" or similar routines; (2) as a substitute or backup for private lines or frame relay connections; (3) to send or receive unusually high numbers of messages; (4) to engage in atypical web usage behaviors; (5) for any activity that adversely affects the ability of other people or systems to use either our wireless services or other parties' Internet-based resources; and (6) for any other reason that, in our sole discretion, harms our network. <strong>UNLIMITED USE PLANS.</strong>If you subscribe to rate plans, services or features that are described as unlimited, you should be aware that such "unlimited" plans are subject to these Virgin Mobile Prohibited Network Uses and Virgin Mobile's General Terms and Conditions. </p>
									<p><strong>THROUGHPUT LIMITATIONS:</strong> With select plans and product offers, Virgin Mobile reserves the right, without notice, to limit throughput speeds when data usage exceeds the specific thresholds disclosed in its service offers. Customers will continue to have data access but maximum speeds may be limited per your plan to the following speeds for the remainder of the plan cycle: Beyond Talk: 256Kbps or below after the combined 3G/4G allotment has been reached and Broadband2Go: 2Mbps on the 4G network (customers who reach the allotment on 3G must wait until the next plan cycle begins to access the network). During this time, customers may experience slower page loads, file downloads and degraded streaming media. Throughput speeds will be restored when your new plan begins. <strong>Network Management and Performance:</strong> For important information on Sprint's network management tools, policies and other related information, please visit Sprint.com/networkmanagement.</p>
									<p><strong>Messaging (text, picture, video, email and IM):</strong> Domestic and international messaging rates are subject to change. Standard message rates are charged when a message is sent or received, whether read or unread, viewed or unviewed, solicited or unsolicited. There is no guarantee messages will be received and we are not responsible for lost or misdirected messages. <strong>Directory Assistance: </strong>$1.99/call plus standard airtime rates. <strong>Mobile Hotspot on Phones:</strong> Available only with select phones and compatible plans. Hotspot data limit for phones is combination of phone and hotspot usage, if applicable. Connectivity dependent upon compatibility and speeds may vary. International: International long distance rates are subject to change at any time without notice. Usage initiated near country borders may be carried by a cell site in a neighboring country and billed at that country's rates. <strong>GPS Navigation: </strong>Environment may limit GPS location information. <strong>Third-Party Content: </strong>Subscribers may purchase mobile content on a per item or monthly basis from Virgin Mobile storefronts and other entities. Content fees will be deducted from subscriber's account balance. Subscribers are responsible for all billed content, including content purchased by others authorized to use devices on the account. Call care for information on usage controls (e.g., account blocking tools or similar features). Deleting third-party applications from your device alone may not stop the billing of monthly recurring charges. Local phone numbers may not be available in certain markets. Additional fees may apply for phone number or equipment change requests (e.g., changing to a new phone) processed by customer service. You can request to change your mobile phone number up to three times each year.</p>
									<p><strong>Adding Funds to Your Account.</strong> Funds can be added using one of Virgin Mobile's Payment methods (credit, debit, or Top-Up cards, and for Beyond Talk and payLo Plans only, Paypal). Customers can add a maximum of $120/transaction to their accounts and their total account balance cannot exceed $400. Account funds cannot be transferred between Virgin Mobile accounts and cannot be applied to any other wireless service. Adding funds through Virgin Mobile customer service may result in processing fees. </p>
									<p><strong>Payment Date &amp; Account Active Period Information: </strong>Additional funds should be added at least once every calendar month for monthly plans or 30, 45, 90 days for pay-as-you-go plans to keep your service active or your service will be interrupted (excludes calls to care and 911) and you will lose any unused monthly voice, data or message allotments. To keep your Broadband2Go account active, a data plan must be purchased once per year. You will have 150 days after your last payment (one year for Broadband2Go) to add money to your account to prevent cancellation, loss of all funds comprising your account balance and your telephone number. Lost funds are nonrefundable. <strong>Recurring Plans: </strong>Funds are due on your payment date, which is based on the day when you purchase, restart, switch to or activate your plan. Plans purchased at the end of the month (28th -31st for Broadband2Go and 29th-31st for all other plans) will have the first day of the month as the payment date, which will start on the month following your payment date. This date will be reset to your next successful payment date if you fail to pay for service when due. Voice, data and message allotments will be restored when you make a payment. Payments for plan services do not include separately priced services, including, but not limited to, International services, wireless entertainment &amp; downloads. <strong>Advanced Payment: </strong>When you add funds that equal or exceed your monthly payment amount during your monthly cycle, we will deduct your next monthly recurring charge from your account balance. You may only pay one monthly recurring charge in advance. You can cancel the Advance Payment up to an hour before your next monthly recurring charge is due online in My Account. Advanced Payment may not be available with all products, services and offers, including, but not limited to, mobile broadband plans. <strong>payLo Pay As You Go Plans: </strong>Account active period is based on amount of funds added to your account. <strong>Active Period for Amounts Between $10-$19.99:</strong> If you added $10-$19.99 to your account, your account will remain active for 45 days. <strong>Active Period for Amounts over $20. </strong>If you added $20 or more to your account, the account will remain active for 90 days. Funds will be lost the following day after the active period. <strong>PayLo monthly plans:</strong> You must add sufficient funds within 91 days from your last payment or your account balance will be forfeited.</p>

Customer may return the complete, undamaged device in its original packaging and all of its components along with the original receipt. Devices purchased from other retail locations are subject to the other location's return policy. </p>
