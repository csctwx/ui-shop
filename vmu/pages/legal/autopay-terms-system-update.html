                        <em>The following terms and conditions are specific to Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up payments and are supplemental to (and do not supersede) the Virgin Mobile® Service Agreement, which includes the Important Service/Product Specific and General Terms and Conditions of Service, that you received and accepted when you first became a Virgin Mobile® customer. Your continued access to or use of the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service after the receipt and review hereof constitutes your consent to the terms contained herein and your continued consent to the terms contained in the Service Agreement. You also continue to be bound by the terms of the Virgin Mobile® Privacy Policy which details the conditions and circumstances under which, in the ordinary course of business, Virgin Mobile® may provide information concerning you or your account to third parties. All of these terms and policy are available at <u>http://www.virginmobileusa.com/legal/important-service-product-information.html.</u></em>

                       <br />
                       <p>
The following "Recurring Terms & Conditions" apply to all Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up Payment Options. Three "Payment-Specific Terms & Conditions" follow these General Terms & Conditions and govern the three individual Payment Options offered under Auto Payment or Auto Top-Up: (i) Low Balance, and (ii) Monthly, and (iii) 90-Day. Only one of the two Payment-Specific Terms & Conditions will apply to you, depending on which Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up Payment Option you selected when you enrolled in Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up.                        
                       </p>

                       <p style="text-align:center">(Applicable to <span style="text-decoration:underline">ALL</span> Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up Subscribers)</p>
                       <h4>General Payment Information</h4>
                       <p>
A valid major credit card, debit card or PayPal account (a "Registered Payment Method") must be registered and on file with Virgin Mobile® at all times to take advantage of automatic payments. Only one (1) card or PayPal account may be registered for any Virgin Mobile™ telephone number. If a payment is returned for any reason, you will not be able to use a credit/debit card or PayPal until your account is in good standing. If you need to change or update your payment information, please either call Virgin Mobile™ Customer Care (dial *729 from your Virgin Mobile™ handset) or access "My Account".                        
                       </p>
                       <h4>Billing; Notifications</h4>
                       <p>
<span class="bold">You will be automatically billed for the recurring payments corresponding to your Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up Payment Option as set forth under the applicable Payment-Specific Terms & Conditions below until you affirmatively unenroll from the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service in accordance with the section below entitled "Unenroll". These recurring charges and all other charges to your account are nonrefundable.</span> Virgin Mobile® will send a text message notification to your Virgin Mobile™ handset or email if you have a broadband device indicating whether the attempt to charge your Registered Payment Method was successful and, if so, how much was charged and when the charge was made. Virgin Mobile® will not charge you for these text or email messages. These notifications will be your only notices of payment. By law, you also have the right to receive notice 10 days prior to any transfer that varies in amount from the previous transfer or from the amount you selected at the time of the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up enrollment; <span class="bold"><u>however</u>, by enrolling in the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service, you elect to receive such notice only when a transfer differs from the previous transfer by more than $10.00.</span>                        
                       </p>
                       <h4>Adding Funds Manually</h4>
                       <p>
You can manually add funds using your Registered Payment Method on file either by accessing the "Pay Now" section under "My Account" or by calling Virgin Mobile™ Customer Care (dial *729 from your Virgin Mobile™ handset). You can also add funds at any authorized Virgin Mobile® replenishment location.                        
                       </p>
                       <h4>Unenroll</h4>
                       <p>
To unenroll from the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service, you must affirmatively unenroll either by calling Virgin Mobile™ Customer Care (dial *729 from your Virgin Mobile™ handset) or by checking the appropriate "I don't want to use it to pay for my Monthly Plan or any other monthly charges" box for Monthly Auto Pay or “I don't want Auto Top-Up” for Low Balance or 90-Day Auto Top-Up under My Account". Cancellation will become effective immediately. <span class="bold">You understand that by unenrolling you will be terminating not just your selected Payment Option, you will be terminating your Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service entirely. Switching to a new Payment Option will require you to re-enroll in the Auto Pay or Auto Top-Up service.</span> However, unenrolling will not delete the Registered Payment Method you have on file.                        
                       </p>

                        <li>(2) A description of the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and a clear explanation of why you believe it is an error or why you need more information; and</li>

Within 10 business days after your call or our receipt of your written statement containing the information described above, we will attempt to determine whether an error has occurred and if it has, we will promptly correct the error. However, we may require up to 45 days to investigate the matter (90 days for new accounts or point-of-sale or foreign transactions), and if we do, we will temporarily credit the disputed amount to your account within 10 business days (20 business days for new accounts) so that you will have the use of the money or airtime during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account.                        
                       </p>
                       <p>
We will inform you of the results of our investigation within three business days after completion. If we determine that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. If we determine there was an error, we will promptly credit the appropriate airtime or dollar amount to your account. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
