</ul>
								
<p>$35, $45 and $55 plans include 2.5GB of high-speed data.  Video streaming may be limited to 3G speeds. Anytime minutes are for domestic use only and may be used at any time on any day.  Each minute that you use will be deducted from the available minutes in your Beyond Talk Plan.  If you use all the available minutes in your Beyond Talk Plan, each additional minute will be charged at a rate of 10¢/min. International services are extra.  You must have sufficient funds in your account to cover the cost of any additional minutes and/or other services not included in your monthly plan.</p>
								
<p class="bold_underline">Account Status for Expired Beyond Talk Plans above</p>
								
<p>Your monthly charge is due on the monthly payment date of your Expired Beyond Talk Plan. Your monthly payment date is based on the day of the month that you activated your Expired Beyond Talk Plan, switched from one Beyond Talk Plan to the Expired Beyond Talk Plan, or restarted your existing Expired Beyond Talk Plan. If you do not pay your monthly charge on your payment date, you will not be able to make or receive calls (except 911 emergency calls), send or receive domestic text messages, picture messages, IM and email messages (collectively "Messages"), access Downloads (VirginXL), or use any other services, regardless of the balance in your account. When you next pay your monthly charge, you will receive the number of minutes and Messages associated with that monthly plan. If you fail to pay your monthly charge when due, your payment date will be reset based on the day you successfully pay your monthly charge. If you do not pay your monthly charge within 120 days after your payment date, your account will expire, we will deactivate your service, you will lose your mobile phone number, and we will assess you a termination charge equal to the value of any balance left in your account, which is not refundable even if you reactivate your account. If your account is deactivated, you must follow the activation process again in order to obtain service and use your Virgin Mobile phone. You may visit our website (www.virginmobileusa.com) or contact Virgin Mobile At Your Service at 1-888-322-1122 to reactivate your account using a Top-Up card, debit card or credit card. Beginning March 23, 2012, Virgin Mobile may limit video streaming to 3G speeds. Virgin Mobile will also begin limiting throughput data speeds (including video) when monthly data usage on your Beyond Talk Monthly Plan exceeds 2.5GB. You will continue to have access to your service but maximum speeds may be limited to 128kilobits per second or below for the remainder of your monthly plan cycle. During this time, you may experience slower page loads, file downloads and degraded streaming media. Throughput speeds will be restored when you pay your next monthly charge.</p>

<li><span class="italic">payLo "Basic Rate"</span><br>Pay 20¢ for each voice minute you use.</li>
<li><span class="italic">Minute Packs with Roll Forward</span><br>20¢ per Minute Pay As You Go Rate customers may purchase Minute Packs for anytime minutes which may be used at any time of any day on the following terms:
	<ul class="list">
		<li>$20 for 200 anytime minutes.</li>
		<li>$30 for 400 anytime minutes.</li>
		<li>$50 for 1,000 anytime minutes.</li>
	</ul>
Each minute that you use will be deducted from the available minutes in your Minute Pack. If you use all the available minutes in your Minute Pack, each additional minute costs 20¢. Calls received having a restricted or unavailable phone number may be charged at the 20¢ per Minute Pay As You Go Rate even if you have purchased a Minute Pack. Minute Packs, including any unused minutes, expire one calendar month from the date you purchase the Minute Pack, whether you used the minutes or not. If you purchase an additional Minute Pack within one calendar month of your last Minute Pack purchase, you may roll forward all current unused minutes from your last Minute Pack purchase for an additional calendar month, but at no point may you roll forward more than 5 unused Minute Packs of the same denomination.(10- for $20 for 200 anytime minute pack)</li>
</ul>
								
<p class="bold_underline">Account Status for Expired Virgin Mobile Pay As You Go Plans</p>
<p>If you are enrolled in one of the Expired Virgin Mobile Pay As You Go plans above, your account will remain active (the "Active Period") for:
</p><ul class="list_unstyled">
	<li><span class="bold">90 days</span> after you add ("Top-Up") <span class="bold">at least $20</span>; OR,</li>
	<li><span class="bold">45 days</span> after you Top-Up <span class="bold">at least $10</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also sign up for automatic payments ("Auto Top-Up"), which will automatically deduct an amount from your registered payment method and add it to your account once every 90 days and when your account balance falls below $5.00.
<br>
During the Expired Pay As You Go Plan Active Period, you may make calls and use VirginXL or VirginXtras if you have a positive account balance sufficient to pay for the services. If you do not Top-Up again during the 45-day or 90-day Active Period, your account will become inactive on the day following the expiration of the Active Period. If your account is inactive, you may not make or receive calls (other than 911 emergency calls), send or receive text messages, download ringtones, or use any other services - even if you have money in your account.
<br>
During the 60 days following the expiration of the Expired Plan Active Period (the " Inactive Period"), you may Top-Up your account to make it active again. All of the airtime in your account will be renewed for:
	</p><ul class="list_unstyled">
		<li><span class="bold">90 days</span> if you Top-Up <span class="bold">at least $20</span>; OR</li>
		<li><span class="bold">45 days</span> if you Top-Up <span class="bold">at least $10</span>.</li>
	</ul>
								
By doing one of the above, you will be allowed to keep your mobile phone number.
However, if you do not Top-Up during the Inactive Period, your Account will expire and we will deactivate your service. In addition, you will lose your mobile phone number and will be assessed a termination charge equal to the value of the remaining balance in your account.<br><br>
Your monthly Minute Packs for the Expired Pay As Go Minute Pack plans, start on the day of the month that you purchase the Minute Pack. We will deduct all monthly recurring charges for your Minute Pack from your cash balance every month. If you have an insufficient balance and have authorized a registered payment method, we will charge your registered payment method. If you do not have sufficient funds in your account and have not authorized a registered payment method, or the charge to your registered payment method is declined, your Minute Pack subscription will be terminated and, unless you purchase an additional Minute Pack by 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the day your last Minute Pack is set to expire, unused minutes will not roll forward.<br><br>
If your account expires and is deactivated, you must follow the activation process again in order to obtain service. Please go to our website (www.virginmobileusa.com) or contact Virgin Mobile At Your Service at 1-888-322-1122 to reactivate your account using a Top-Up card or a debit/credit card. Although you may reactivate your account, you will not be able to reclaim the cash balance or any minutes/messages that remained in your account or the mobile phone number assigned to your account before it expired.<p></p>
								
<p class="bold_underline">Expired Messaging Packs</p>
								
<p>"Messaging Packs" are subscriptions for one calendar month of domestic Messages.</p>
<p class="italic">Messaging Packs Associated with Expired Pay As You Go Plans</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>$2.00 for 30 messages</li>
	<li>$5.00 for 200 messages</li>
	<li>$10.00 for 1,000 messages</li>
	<li>$20.00 for unlimited messages</li>
</ul>

<p>Each domestic Message that you send or receive will be deducted from the available Messages in your purchased Messaging Pack. Unused Messages expire on the last day of your monthly Messaging Pack period and will not be applied to subsequently purchased Messaging Packs. If you use all of the Messages in your Messaging Pack, each additional domestic text message, IM and email costs 15¢, and each additional picture message costs 25¢. If you do not have sufficient funds in your account to pay your monthly charge, you will not receive your monthly allocation of Messages associated with your Messaging Pack and you will be charged 15¢ for each domestic text message, email message, email notification message, and IM and 25¢ for each picture message. The next month you will be charged the monthly charge for the Messaging Pack that you previously selected. Messaging Packs do not include international text or picture messaging.</p>

<p class="bold_underline">Account Status for Expired Broadband2Go Plans</p>
<p>With the expired Broadband2Goplans, your monthly charge is due on the monthly payment date of plan. Your monthly payment date is based on the day of the month you purchased, or, restarted, your Broadband2Go plan. If you do not pay your monthly charge on your payment date, you will no longer have access to the Broadband2Go service, regardless of the balance in your account. When you next pay your monthly charge, you will receive the data allocation associated with that monthly plan. If you fail to pay your monthly charge when due, your payment date will be reset based on the day you successfully pay your monthly charge. Virgin Mobile reserves the right, without notice, to temporarily limit throughput speeds when monthly data usage on the $40 or $50 Broadband2Go Plans exceed the established data threshold. You will continue to have access to Broadband2Go service but maximum speeds may be limited to 256 kilobits per second or below for the remainder of your monthly plan cycle. During this time, you may experience slower page loads, file downloads and degraded streaming media. Throughput speeds will be restored when a new Broadband2Go Plan is purchased.<br><br>
Your Broadband2Go account will remain active for one year from your last Broadband2Goplan purchase. If you do not purchase a new Broadband2Go plan within one year of your last Broadband2Go plan purchase, your Broadband2Go account will expire, we will deactivate your Broadband2Go service, you will lose any unused data, and we will assess you a termination charge equal to the balance in your account, which is not refundable even if you reactivate your account. If your Broadband2Go service is deactivated, you must follow the activation process again to obtain Broadband2Go service. You may visit our website (www.virginmobileusa.com) or contact Virgin Mobile At Your Service at 1-877-877-8443 to reactivate your account. Although you may reactivate your account, you will not be able to reclaim the cash balance or any data that remained in your account before it expired. Virgin Mobile phone and Broadband2Go accounts are maintained separately, and you may not transfer the balance between your Virgin Mobile phone account and your Broadband2Go account.</p>
