IMPORTANT SERVICE / PRODUCT SPECIFIC TERMS<br />
TERMS OF SERVICE</h3>
<br />
<p>Your Virgin Mobile Custom ("Custom") service is subject to the terms of your Virgin Mobile Custom service plan (including those outlined below and those which may be presented on your device and/or in other materials) and the most recent Virgin Mobile Custom General Terms and Conditions of Service available at <a href="http://virginmobileusa.com/legal/terms-and-conditions"><u>virginmobileusa.com/legal/terms-and-conditions</u></a>(collectively, "Agreement"). Carefully read all of the parts of your Agreement including the MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION and CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION. </p>
<br />
<p>Price, rates, offers & programs are subject to change without notice, may not be available with all devices, in all markets/retail locations, or combinable with other promotions/options. Certain applications and/or features preinstalled on your device may not be operational or available. Service charges are not refunded or prorated if service is terminated. Unused services, including but not limited to, minute, messaging or data allotments expire at the end of each plan cycle. Partial minutes of use will be rounded up to the next whole minute. Switching between other Virgin Mobile service offerings may result in a new prepaid account. State & local sales taxes and fees may apply when adding funds to your account. </p>
<br />
<p>Coverage not available everywhere and varies by service. Visit <a href="http://virginmobileusa.com/custom/check-cell-phone-coverage"><u>virginmobileusa.com/custom/check-cell-phone-coverage</u></a> for details and the latest coverage info. Virgin Mobile Custom devices are intended to operate on the Sprint network. Not all services are available with all devices or on all networks and experience may vary and depends on a variety of factors, including device and network compatibility, and/or coverage.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Nature of our Service.</span> Our rate plans, customer devices, services and features are not for resale and are intended for reasonable and non-continuous use by a person using a device on the Sprint network. The primary use of your device and service must be for domestic purposes within the Sprint-owned network and for other purposes outlined in our offers. Domestic means use in the 48 contiguous states, Hawaii, DC, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Virgin Mobile Custom may limit or terminate service if you move outside of the Sprint owned-network.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Unlimited Use Plans.</span> Unlimited does not mean unreasonable. If you subscribe to rate plans, services or features that are described as "unlimited", you should be aware that such unlimited plans are subject to the Prohibited Network Uses detailed below.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Prohibited Network Uses.</span> To ensure that the activities of some users do not impair the ability of our customers to have access to reliable services at reasonable costs, you may not use our services in a manner that is unlawful, infringes on intellectual property rights, or harms or unduly interferes with the use of Sprint's network or systems. Virgin Mobile reserves the right, without notice or limitation, to terminate, end, modify, disconnect or suspend service if an individual engages in any of the prohibited voice or data uses below or if Virgin Mobile, in its sole discretion, determines action is necessary to protect its wireless networks and/or customers' service experience from harm or degradation. <span class="bold">Examples of Prohibited Voice Services uses:</span> Virgin Mobile voice services are provided solely for live dialogue between, and initiated by, individuals for personal use & as otherwise described in this policy. Voice services may not be used for any other purposes including, but not limited to: conference calling, monitoring services, transmission of broadcasts or recorded material, interconnection to other networks, telemarketing, autodialed calls, other commercial uses or connections that do not consist of live dialogue between two individuals. <span class="bold">Examples of Prohibited Data uses:</span> Virgin Mobile data services are intended to be used for web surfing, sending and receiving email, photographs and other similar messaging activities, and the non-continuous streaming of videos, downloading of files or on line gaming. Our data services may not be used to disrupt email use by others using automated or manual routines, including, but not limited to "auto-responders" or cancel bots or other similar routines; to transmit or facilitate any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, telemarketing, promotional materials, "junk mail", unsolicited commercial or bulk email, or fax; or for activities adversely affecting the ability of other people or systems to use either Virgin Mobile's wireless services or other parties' Internet-based resources, including, but not limited to, "denial of service" (DoS) attacks against another network host or individual user.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Usage Limitations:</span> To improve data experience for the majority of users, throughput may be limited, varied or reduced on the network. Streaming video data will be limited to 600Kbps at all times, which may affect quality and performance. With certain plans, throughput data speeds will be slowed when data usage exceeds the selected plan's applicable data threshold(s). During this time, data access will continue but maximum speeds (including video) will be limited to 2G speeds of 128Kbps or below for the remainder of plan cycle, resulting in slower page loads, downloads, and degraded streaming media. Data speeds will be restored at the beginning of a new plan cycle, or after a plan cycle restart. Data usage can be monitored online in 'MyAccount'.

<p><span class="bold">Custom Account & Monthly Plan Setup.</span> All Custom service offers require the creation of a Custom Account ("Account") and selection of a Custom Monthly Plan ("Monthly Plan"). A Monthly Plan consists of any combination of voice minute, text, and/or data service monthly allotments - as well as any add-on services (or "Special Offers"), if any, added to your Monthly Plan. In addition, a monthly line fee or other associated fees will be required for each device added to your Account.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Monthly Plan Cost and Payment.</span> The total cost of your Monthly Plan may vary each month, depending but not limited to: the applicable service allotments selected; added Special Offers, if any; the number of devices on your Account; and any applicable sales tax and fees. State and local taxes may apply when adding funds to your Account. Before using Custom services, you must first pay-in-full for the cost of your Monthly Plan <span class="bold">before</span> you can utilize the services. Payment is made by funds from your Account, which are added through one of the approved Custom payment methods [credit/debit or Custom replenishment (aka "Top-Up") cards]. Adding funds through Custom customer service may result in processing fees., <span class="bold">Note:</span> A maximum of $200 can be added to your Account per transaction, or until your Account balance reaches or exceeds $400. Funds from your Account cannot be transferred between other Virgin Mobile wireless accounts and cannot be used to pay for other Virgin Mobile wireless services.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Monthly Plan Billing Cycle.</span> Payment for your Monthly Plan is recurring and will be due on your monthly billing cycle date which is determined by the calendar date that the <span class="bold">first Custom device</span> was activated on your Account ("Cycle Start Date"). Your Cycle Start Date for your Account will be the same calendar date for all subsequent months; <span class="bold">unless,</span> activation occurs on the last calendar date, which will result in your Cycle Start Date being the last calendar date for all subsequent months. For example, if activation occurred on March 31st, your Cycle Start Date for the next month would be April 30th and the last calendar date for all subsequent months thereafter (i.e., May 31st, June 30th, etc.). Subsequent monthly billing cycles will automatically renew on the Cycle Start Date of each subsequent month, with Monthly Plan costs collected from your Account at the end of the day at 11:59pm, Pacific Standard Time, of the Cycle Start Date.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Payment and Services:</span> Sufficient funds that cover the total cost of: your Monthly Plan service allotments, applicable Line Fees, any recurring Special Offers, if any, and any applicable taxes and fees, should be added to your Account before your Cycle Start Date in order to keep your Account current and services active. If insufficient funds are in your Account by the Cycle Start Date, your Account will be suspended and your service interrupted (excluding calls to care and 911) and you will lose any unused Monthly Plan voice, SMS and/or data service allotments. You will have 120 days after your Account/service is suspended/interrupted to add sufficient funds to your Account to prevent cancellation, loss of all remaining funds in your Account balance (if any), and your telephone number. Lost funds are nonrefundable. In order to bring your Account in good standing you must pay for the missed payment of your Monthly Plan (if any), Line Fee(s), and recurring Special Offers that were due at the time of suspension. When you bring your Account current, your Cycle Start Date will change for all subsequent months to the calendar date you brought your Account current and in good standing. If payment for your Monthly Plan fails, your services may be suspended until successful payment is made. All purchases and changes to your plan, like upgrades or downgrades, require your account to be in good standing and without failed payments pending. Your account is required to be in good standing in order to purchase new plans, manage devices, or modify your Monthly Services.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Device Line Fee.</span> Each device added to your Account requires payment of a monthly "Line Fee". If a device is added to your Account on a date that is not on your Cycle Start Date (i.e., mid-billing cycle), the Line Fee cost may be prorated based on the days until your next Cycle Start Date. Conversely, no Line Fee credits or refunds will be provided if a device is removed from your Account before your Cycle Start Date. Line Fee service benefits, if any (i.e allotment of minutes, messages or data services) that are included with a Line Fee are applicable only to the first device added to the Account. Adding additional devices and Line Fee payments on your Account will not result in additional Line Fee service benefits. However, additional devices on the Account may share applicable Line Fee services, if any.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Monthly Plan Upgrades and Downgrades:</span> You may elect to increase or decrease your Monthly Plan services by increasing ("Upgrade") or decreasing ("Downgrade") your Monthly Plan service allotments at any time directly on your Custom device(s), or on the Custom website through 'My Account'. Your Upgrade or Downgrade of Monthly Plan services will be effective immediately. Upon any change, you may receive a prorated Account credit for Downgrade of services (except for Line Fees) or, pay the cost difference between the former and new Monthly Plan allotment Upgrade of services. If your Monthly Plan is in suspended status for any reason, you will not be able to Upgrade or Downgrade your Monthly Plan Services, nor, will you be able to add any Special Offers to your Monthly Plan until your Account is current.</p>
<br />
<p><span class="bold">Account Termination.</span> If a successful payment has not been made within 120 days of when your Account was suspended, your Account will be terminated and all active Monthly Plan services (including Special Offers) and connected devices, including their associated telephone numbers, will be removed from your Account. In addition, any unused services and remaining funds in your Account, if any, will be forfeited. If you wish to restart services following an Account termination, you may be subject to a reactivation fee, in addition to selection of a new Monthly Plan, in order to return your Account to good standing. Even if you later bring your Account into good standing after an Account termination, we may not be able to provide you with the same telephone number previously associated with your devices prior to your Account termination.</p>
