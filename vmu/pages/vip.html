				<p class="faq-q">What is the Virgin Mobile VIP program?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">This program provides a benefit to loyal Virgin Mobile customers who are on monthly unlimited plans. The benefit is a <span class="underline">14 Day Payment Grace Period</span>.<br><br>
				A <span class="bold">14 Day Payment Grace Period</span> provides the flexibility to pay your monthly payment up to 14 days late without having your service interrupted.<br><br>			
				</p>

				<ul><li><span class="bold">Note:</span> We recommend you always try to make your monthly payments on time - even if you have the 14 Day Payment Grace Period. That way, you won't risk running past your Grace Period and having your service interrupted.</li></ul>

				<p class="faq-q">What is the 14 Day Payment Grace Period?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">In the Virgin Mobile VIP program, a Payment Grace Period is an amount of time you're allowed to make a payment past its original due date. With the Virgin Mobile VIP program, you have the flexibility to make your monthly payment up to 14 days past the due date without having your service interrupted.<br>
				  <br>
				<span class="underline bold">This is not 14 days of free service.</span><br><br>
				<span class="bold">Think of it <span class="underline">only</span> as a safety net.</span> Your payment is still due the same day each month, but we won't shut off your service for up to 14 days as long as you pay within that 14 day window.<br><br>
				Here's an example:<br><br>
				
				</p>
				<ul><li>Let's say your monthly payment is due today and your new month of service begins tomorrow. If you can't make your payment today, that's okay! Thanks to the Payment Grace Period, your new month of service will begin tomorrow - just like usual. You can keep using your service without interruption as long as you make a payment within the next 14 days.</li></ul>
				<p></p>
				<p class="faq-a">Keep in mind that the Payment Grace Period will not change when your next monthly payment is due. So if you wait the full 14 days to pay after your monthly due date, your next monthly payment will be due in as little as two weeks. That's why <span class="bold">it's always best to make your payments on time</span>.<br><br>
				
				<span class="bold">Note:</span> Full program terms and conditions further below.

				<p class="faq-q">How soon after I enroll in the Virgin Mobile VIP program does the Payment Grace Period take effect?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">It can take up to 5 business days for your enrollment to be processed. So if your new month of service is set to start in the upcoming week, please make your upcoming payment on time to prevent your service from being interrupted.</p>

				<p class="faq-q">How do payments work in the Virgin Mobile VIP program?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">Your monthly payments are still due on the same day at the beginning of each month. If something happens and you can't make your payment on time, the program provides an additional 14 days to pay. If you are unable to make your payment within the additional 14 days, your service will be interrupted.<br><br>
				<span class="bold">Here's an example of how the Payment Grace Period works:</span><br>
				Let's say your monthly payment is due on July 31 and your new month of service begins on August 1...<br><br>
				
				</p>
				<ul class="indented" style="list-style-type:none;">
					<li><span class="bold">Payment made on or before monthly due date:</span> You make your payment on or before July 31. Your new month of service begins August 1 without interruption. Your next monthly payment will be due August 31.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Payment made after monthly due date but within Grace Period:</span>  You miss your payment on July 31. Thanks to your Payment Grace Period, your new month of service automatically begins August 1 without interruption. You make your payment by August 14 (within the 14 day Payment Grace Period!) so your service isn't interrupted. Your next monthly payment will be due August 31.
						<ul>
							<li><span class="bold">Note:</span> If a payment is made before the Grace Period window it will not be held for Advance Payment. These funds will remain in your account balance. This means any actions that incur a charge will deduct funds from that available balance. If a payment is made within the Grace Period window it will be held until the Grace Period end date and applied then.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Payment made after Grace Period end date:</span>  You miss your payment on July 31. Thanks to your Payment Grace Period, your new month of service automatically begins August 1. If you still don't make your payment by August 14, the Grace Period end date, then your service will now be interrupted as of August 15.<br><br>You will need to make your payment to resume service. Payments can be made via any self-service channel.<br><br>If you made your payment to resume service on August 16, your new monthly due date will be September 2, and your Grace Period end date will now be September 16.<br><br>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="bold">Note:</span> Repeated service interruptions may lead to dismissal from the program </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="faq-q">In the Virgin Mobile VIP program, what happens if I make a payment past my Grace Period end date?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">If you do not make a payment before your Grace Period end date your service will be interrupted. You will need to make a payment to resume service. Upon making your payment to resume service, your new payment due date will reset to the calendar day payment was made minus 14 days.<br><br>Repeated service interruptions may lead to dismissal from the program.</p>

				<p class="faq-q">In the Virgin Mobile VIP program, when is my Auto Payment charged with Grace Period?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">We'll charge your Auto Payment method for the full month of service plus any applicable taxes and surcharges on your Grace Period end date.<br><br>For example, let's say your monthly payment is due on July 31 and your new month of service begins on August 1. Your credit/debit card will be charged in 14 days from your month end date on August 14.</p>

				<p class="faq-q">Can I change plans when I am enrolled in the Virgin Mobile VIP program?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">Yes, you can change plans when enrolled in this program. But you may have to make a payment with your plan change. And the 14 Day Grace Period may not apply to your first monthly payment with the new monthly plan.</p>

				<p class="faq-q">Will I receive payment reminders in the Virgin Mobile VIP program?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">Yes.<br><br>You will still receive the standard payment reminder SMS. This will be sent to you before your monthly due date, and before your Grace Period end date. You will also receive new payment reminders via email that will include both your monthly due date and the Grace Period end date. These will also be sent to you before your monthly due date, and before your Grace Period end date.<br><br>
				</p>
				<ul class="bullets">
					<li><span class="bold">Note:</span>  These are system generated reminders. If you have made a payment, please disregard.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Note:</span> To make sure you receive our emails in your inbox, please add email@deliveryvirginmobile.com to your address book.</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<p class="faq-q">How do I cancel my enrollment in the Virgin Mobile VIP program?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">To cancel, please call 855-423-6626 for assistance.</p>
