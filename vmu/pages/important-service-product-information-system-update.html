<span class="bold">Plans:</span> Offers effective 10/8/2015. Price, offers and programs are subject to change without notice, may not be available with all devices or in all markets/retail locations, or combinable with other promotions/options. Virgin Mobile plans do not require an annual contract. Certain phones require activation on certain plans and availability may be subject to device availability and/or compatibility. Services are for domestic use only within the U.S. unless stated otherwise and include Caller ID, Voicemail, Call Waiting, Three-way Calling and Call Forwarding while on the Nationwide Sprint Network (usage of minutes will apply).                            
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p> 
<span class="bold">Terms of Service:</span> Your service agreement with Virgin Mobile includes, but is not limited to, the terms of your service plan (including those outlined below and set forth in plan disclosure terms, and device materials) and the most recent Virgin Mobile General Terms and Conditions of Service (collectively, the "Agreement"). Carefully read all the parts of your Agreement with Virgin Mobile, including the MANDATORY ARBITRATION Provision and CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISION set forth in the Agreement.                                               
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
<span class="bold">Activation of Services/Accounts:</span> Activation of service and account will occur when sufficient funds are added to accounts. Service charges are not refunded or prorated if service is terminated or, modified before your next payment due date. Unused services, including, but not limited to, plan minutes, messages or data allotments, expire at the end of each plan cycle or when switching between service plans and do not carry forward. Partial minutes of use are rounded up to the next whole minute. Switching between Virgin Mobile service offerings may result in a new prepaid account. State, local sales taxes and fees may apply when adding funds to accounts. Our services will only work with our devices - not all services are available with all devices or on all networks. Not all services available on 4G and coverage may default to 3G/1xRTT where 4G is unavailable.                                                
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
<span class="bold">Nature of our Service:</span> Our rate plans, customer devices, services and features are not for resale and are intended for reasonable and non-continuous use by a person using a device on the Sprint network. The primary use of your device must be for domestic purposes within the Sprint-owned network and for other purposes outlined in our offers. Domestic means use in the 48 contiguous states, Hawaii, DC, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Virgin Mobile may limit or terminate service if you move outside of the Sprint owned-network.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
<span class="bold">Unlimited Use Plans:</span> Unlimited does not mean unreasonable. If you subscribe to rate plans, services or features that are described as "unlimited", you should be aware that such unlimited plans are subject to the Prohibited Network Uses detailed below.                            
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
<span class="bold">Prohibited Network Uses:</span> To ensure that the activities of some users do not impair the ability of our customers to have access to reliable services at reasonable costs, you may not use our services in a manner that is unlawful, infringes on intellectual property rights, or harms or unduly interferes with the use of Sprint's network or systems. Virgin Mobile reserves the right, without notice or limitation, to terminate, end, modify, disconnect or suspend service if an individual engages in any of the prohibited voice or data uses below or if Virgin Mobile, in its sole discretion, determines action is necessary to protect its wireless networks and/or customers' service experience from harm or degradation. Examples of Prohibited Voice Services uses: Virgin Mobile voice services are provided solely for live dialogue between, and initiated by, individuals for personal use & as otherwise described in this policy. Voice services may not be used for any other purposes including, but not limited to: conference calling, monitoring services, transmission of broadcasts or recorded material, interconnection to other networks, telemarketing, autodialed calls, other commercial uses or connections that do not consist of live dialogue between two individuals. Examples of Prohibited Data uses: Virgin Mobile data services are intended to be used for web surfing, sending and receiving email, photographs and other similar messaging activities, and the non-continuous streaming of videos, downloading of files or on line gaming.

<span class="bold">Usage Limitations:</span> To improve data experience for the majority of users, throughput may be limited, varied or reduced on the network. With certain plans, throughput data speeds will be slowed when data usage exceeds the selected plan's applicable data threshold(s). During this time, data access will continue but maximum speeds will be limited to 2G speeds of 128Kbps or below for the remainder of plan cycle, resulting in slower page loads, downloads, and degraded streaming media. Data speeds will be restored at the beginning of a new plan cycle, or after a plan cycle restart. Data usage can be monitored online in 'MyAccount'.
